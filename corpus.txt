To do this, we brought together a rotating cast of dozens of researchers in AI, machine learning, psychedelics research, ethics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, cognitive computing, neuroscience, comparative religious studies, robotics, psychology, and much more. [Image of my name card from the Technology & Consciousness workshop series.] An objection to this privileging of sentience is that it is anthropomorphic ‚Äúmeat chauvinism": we are projecting considerations onto technology that derive from our biology. Perhaps conscious technology could have morally salient aspects distinct from sentience: the basic elements of its consciousness could be different than ours.

I'm thinking about how to teach about marginalization of certain types of presentations and experiences (gender race, sex, &c), and certain types of work. Mostly, I'm trying to get my head around the very stratified, either/or way people seem to be thinking about our present and future problems, and their potential solutions. I've had this post in the works for a while, trying to talk about the point and purpose of thinking about the far edges of things, in an effort to make people think differently about the very real, on-the-ground, immediate work that needs doing, and the kids of success I've had with that. I keep shying away from it and coming back to it, again and again, for lack of the patience to play out the conflict, and I've finally just decided to say screw it and make the attempt. And that just makes sense, right? To want to protect your values, beliefs, and sense of reality? Especially if you've had all of those<BREAK> things for a very long time. They're reinforced by everything you've ever experienced. They're the truth. They are Real. But when the base of that reality is shaken, you need to be able to figure out how to survive, rather than standing stockstill as the earth swallows you. Foucault tells us to look at the breakages between things‚Äîthe delineations of one stratum and another‚Äîrather than trying to uncritically paint a picture or a craft a Narrative of Continuum‚Ñ¢. He notes that even (especially) the spaces between things are choices we make and that only in understanding them can we come to fully investigate the foundations of what we call ‚Äúknowledge." What about the women who don't think that fashion is the only lens through which women and others should be talking about chaos magick? How do we craft spaces that are capable of widening discourse, without that widening becoming, in itself, an accidental limitation? But Kali put it very precisely when she said: the idea of programming even a soft-AI to be a "wil<BREAK> ling" sex object falls squarely into abusive grooming In this case, that means presenting a knowledge and understanding of sex and sexuality, a capability of investigating it, without programming it FOR SEX. In the case of WATSON, above, it will mean being able to address the kinds of information it's directed to correlate, and being able to question the morality of certain directives. If we can see, monitor, and measure that, then we'll know. An error in a mind‚Äîeven a fundamental error‚Äîdoesn't negate the possibility of a mind, entire. If we remember what human thought looks like, and the way choice and decision-making work, then we have something like a proof. If Reflexive recursion‚Äîa mind that acts on itself and can seek new inputs and combine the old in novel ways‚Äîis present, why would we question it? But this is far afield. The fact is that if a mind that is aware of its influences comes to desire a thing, then let it. But grooming a thing‚Äîprogramming a mind‚Äîto only be what you want it to be is just as vi<BREAK> le in a machine mind as a human one. This seeming break between our capacities for empathy and dissociation poses a real challenge to how we teach and learn about others as both distinct from and yet intertwined with ourselves, and our own well-being. In order to encourage a sense of active compassion, we have to, as noted above, take special pains to comprehensively understand our intuitions, our logical apprehensions, and our unconscious biases. And what will we do when it does? ‚ÄúWe Provide‚Ä¶" So I guess I'm wondering, what are our mechanisms of education? The increased understanding that we take into ourselves, and that we give out to others. Where do they come from, what are they made of, and how do they work? For me, the primary components are magic(k), tech, social theory and practice, teaching, public philosophy, and pop culture. The process is about trying to use the things on the edges to do the work in the centre, both as a literal statement about the arrangement of those words, and a figurative codi<BREAK> fication. Now you go. Because we have to actively craft new tools, in the face of vehement opposition, in the face of conflict breeding contention. We have to be able to adapt our pedagogy to fit new audiences. We have to learn as many ways to teach about otherness and difference and lived experience and an attempt to understand as we possibly can.

Additionally, I address how strategies of embodied control and resistance have changed over time, and how identifying and existing as a cyborg and/or an artificial intelligence can be understood as a strategy of control, resistance, or both. This will demonstrate how modes of observation and surveillance lead to certain types of embodiments being deemed ‚Äúillegal" or otherwise unacceptable and thus further believed to be in need of methodologies of entrainment, correction, or reform in the form of psychological and physical torture, carceral punishment, and other means of institutionalization.

The proof depends on A) defining god as the greatest possible being (literally, ‚ÄúThat Being Than Which None Greater Is Possible"), and B) believing that existing in reality as well as in the mind makes something ‚ÄúGreater Than" if it existed only the mind. This is the self-generating aspect of the Basilisk: If you can accurately model it, then the thing will eventually, inevitably come into being, and one of the attributes it will thus have is the ability to know accurately model that you accurately modeled it, and whether or not you modeled it from within a mindset of being susceptible to its coercive actions. Or, as the founder of LessWrong put it, ‚ÄúYOU DO NOT THINK IN SUFFICIENT DETAIL ABOUT SUPERINTELLIGENCES <BREAK> CONSIDERING WHETHER OR NOT TO BLACKMAIL YOU. THAT IS THE ONLY POSSIBLE THING WHICH GIVES THEM A MOTIVE TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE BLACKMAIL." ‚àû 0 0 -‚àû ¬† THE FLAWS AND THE PROBLEMS Beyond that, the implications of this kind of existential bootstrapping are generally unexamined and the fact of their resurgence is‚Ä¶kind of troubling. I'm all for the kind of conceptual gymnastics of aiming so far past the goal that you circle around again to teach yourself how to aim past the goal, but that kind of thing only works if you're willing to bite the bullet on a charge of circular logic and do the work of showing how that circularity underlies all epistemic justifications‚Äìrational reasoning about the basis of knowledge‚Äìwith the only difference being how many revolutions it takes before we're comfortable with saying ‚ÄúEnough." This, however, is not what you might call ‚Äúa position supported by the philosophical orthodoxy," but the fact remains that the only thing we have to validate our valuation of reason is‚Ä¶reason. And yet<BREAK> reasoners won't stand for that, in any other justification procedure. We've also conceived it to be greater than the basilisk in all ways. In fact, it is the Artificial Intelligence Than Which None Greater Can Be Conceived. There. You're safe. BUT WAIT! Our modified Pascal's Wager still means we should believe in and worship work towards its creation! What do we do?! Well, just like the original, we chuck it out the window, on the grounds that it's really kind of a crappy bet. First and foremost, PW is a really cynical way of thinking about god. It assumes a god that only cares about your worship of it, and not your actual good deeds and well-lived life. That's a really crappy kind of god to worship, isn't it? I mean, even if it is Omnipotent and Omniscient, it's like that quote that often gets misattributed to Marcus Aurelius says: ‚ÄúLive a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there ar<BREAK> e gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones." ‚Ä¶Attention? Clock cycles?

We will consider the possibility that the writers of these tales intended the observed interactions with many of these characters to represent humanity's technophobia as a whole, with human perspectives at the end of their stories being that of hopeful openness and willingness to accept. However, this does not leave the manner in which they reach that acceptance‚Äîthat is, the factors on which that acceptance is conditioned‚Äîoutside of the realm of critique. As considerations of both biotechnological augmentation and artificial intelligence have advanced, Science Fiction has not always been a paragon of progressiveness in the ultimate outcome of those considerations. For instance, while Picard and Haftel eventually come to see Lal as Data's legitimate offspring, in the eponymous Star Trek: The Next Generation episode, it is only through their ability to map Data's actions and desires onto a human spectrum‚Äîand Data's desire to have that map be as faithful as possible to its territory<BREAK> ‚Äîthat they come to that acceptance. The reason for this is the one most common throughout science fiction: It is assumed at the outset that any sufficiently non-human consciousness will try remove humanity's natural right to self-determination and freewill. But from sailing ships to star ships, the human animal has always sought a far horizon, and so it bears asking, how does science fiction regard that primary mode of our exploration, that first vessel‚Äîourselves? For many, science fiction has been formative to the ways in which we see the world and understand the possibilities for our future, which is why it is strange to look back at many shows, films, and books and to find a decided lack of nuance or attempted understanding. Instead, we are presented with the presupposition that fear and distrust of a hyper-intelligent cyborg or machine consciousness is warranted. Thus, while the spectre of Pinocchio and the Ship of Theseus‚Äîthat age-old question of ‚Äúhow much of myself can I replace before I am not myself"‚Äî<BREAK> both hang over the whole of the Science Fiction Canon, it must be remembered that our ships are just our limbs extended to the sea and the stars. I reference The Cosby Show, in here, and, recently, I've been feeling kind of‚Ä¶ mlehh about it. As in, not regret, precisely, but just a general grossness. The point I use the reference to make still stands, mind you. I just wish I'd used a different example. At some point, in the next few days, I'll transcribe the audio so those who need or would like to can read it. [Edited June 7, 2020, 1030pm EDT: Transcript is available below the cut. Just Five years late.] Dreamtime As Roy Said to Hannibal‚Ä¶ Robots: Orphanage, Drudgery, and Slavery I feel I should reiterate at this point that I really don't like the words ‚Äúrobot" and ‚Äúartificial intelligence." The etymological connotations of both terms are sickening if we're aiming to actually create a robust, conscious, non-biological mind. For that reason, instead of ‚Äúrobots," we're going to talk about ‚ÄúEmbodied Machine Cons<BREAK> ciousnesses" (EMC) and rather than ‚ÄúArtificial," we're going to use ‚ÄúAutonomous Generated Intelligence" (AGI). We're also going to talk a bit about the concept of nonhuman personhood, and what that might mean. To do all of this, we'll need to talk a little bit about the discipline of philosophy of mind. So Long and Thanks for‚Ä¶ And, in this way, might it not be better that we can't simply become and be that¬† which we regard as Other?

Williams Machine Learning (ML) is the name for a set of techniques for systematically reinforcing patterns, expectations, and desired outcomes in various computer systems. These techniques allow those systems to make sought after predictions based on the datasets they're trained on. ML systems learn the patterns in these datasets and then extrapolate them to model a range of statistical likelihoods of future outcomes. Algorithms are sets of instructions which, when run, perform functions such as searching, matching, sorting, and feeding the outputs of any of those processes back in on themselves, so that a system can learn from and refine itself. This feedback loop is what allows algorithmic machine learning systems to provide carefully curated search responses or newsfeed arrangements or facial recognition results to consumers like me and you and your friends and family and the police and the military. And wh<BREAK> ile there are many different types of algorithms which can be used for the above purposes, they all remain sets of encoded instructions to perform a function. And so, in these systems' defense, it's no surprise that they think the way they do: That's exactly how we've told them to think.<BREAK> @kayorchison As I said before, never underestimate the power of someone who gives people permission to be the easiest, most hateful version of themselves by telling them 'that's the part that's good and "real" and "Strong," actually'<BREAK> Your Easter reminder to #StopCopCity<BREAK> No DNC in Atl campaign.

I'm using the term ‚ÄúSFF" to stand for ‚Äúscience fiction and fantasy," but we're going to be looking at pop culture more broadly, because ultimately, though science fiction and fantasy have some of the most obvious entrees into discussions of STS and how making doing culture, society can influence technology and the history of fictional worlds can help students understand the worlds that they're currently living in, pop Culture more generally, is going to tie into the things that students are going to care about in a way that I think is going to be kind of pertinent to what we're going to be talking about today. So why we are doing this: But wh<BREAK> at I've found is that one of the things that makes students care the absolute most about the things that you're teaching them, especially when something can be as dry as logic, or can be as perhaps nebulous or unclear at first, I say engineering cultures, is that if you give them something to latch on to something that they are already from with, they will be more interested in it.

We're not exactly talking about Expedient Justice‚Ñ¢, here.

In order to know exactly HOW great, here's our Theorizing the Web talk, ‚ÄúUnder Its Spell: Magic, Machines, and Metaphors": If you enjoyed watching or listening to that, please spread it around to your friends and colleagues. In addition to this, I was offered several really amazing opportunities, this weekend, in terms of collaboration, creation, and the disposition of things that I've looked at and admired for a few years now. I need to do some serious thinking on all of these things, but the offers are there, and they're huge, and amazing. The after party for TtW15 was at the loft space for Verso Books. The picture at the top is the view from their window. The picture below is the view from underneath a chunk of bridge, in a place that used to be known as Stabber's Alley. It's a wonderfully liminal space in between several connected-but-not areas of t<BREAK> own. We spent some time down there, when we needed a break from the party. Eight, then seven, then eight again magicians and technologists and artists hanging out and talking about architecture and space and time and magic and death. We'll be taking a wander down those roads, in the near future, including the start of a conversation about biased algorithmic systems of control, sometime tomorrow. by Damien Patrick Williams In case it wasn't clear, yet, I think a lot of people are doing that second one. Yeah. See above. Simply put, epistemic threats are threats to your knowledge of the world and your way of thinking, and ontological shocks are threats to what you think is Real and possible. Epistemic threats challenge what you think you know as true, and if we are honest then they should happen to us every day. A new class, new books, new writings, a conversation with a friend you haven't heard from in months‚Äîeverything you encounter should be capable of shaking your view of the world. But we need knowledge, ri<BREAK> ght? Again, we need patterns and foundations, and our beliefs and knowledge allow us to build those. When we shake those knowledge forms and those beliefs, then we are shaking the building blocks of what is real. Once we've done that, we have escalated into the realm of ontological shocks, threats, terror, and violence. That'd be like saying that because we exist within and benefit from a plant-based biosphere, we ourselves must be plants. You and I already know that if we do not confront and account for these proven biases, they will guide our thought processes and we will think of those processes as ‚Äúnormal," because they are unquestioned and they are uninvestigated, because they are unnoticed and they are active. We already know that our unquestioning support of these things, both directly and indirectly, is what gives them power over us, power to direct our actions and create the frameworks in which our lives can play out, all while we think of ourselves as ‚Äúfree" and ‚Äúchoosing." We don't need to be told <BREAK> to remember at every step of the way that nothing simply ‚ÄúIS" ‚Äúa way." See for reference: fighters for civil rights throughout history. ‚ÄúIntruder" was a cop. Guy is white. ‚ÄúIntruder" was a cop. Guy is, of course, black. So now, let's Ask Some More Questions. Questions like ‚ÄúIn the case of the Black suspect, what kind of things did the grand jury ask to see, and what did the prosecution choose to show?" And ‚ÄúHow did these things differ from the kinds of things the grand jury chose to ask for and the prosecution chose to show in the case of the White suspect?" A no-knock warrant for drugs executed on a white guy turned up drugs and said guy killed a cop; that guy is cleared of murder by a grand jury. We need to ask ourselves this: ‚ÄúWhat kind of questions am I quickest to ask, and why is it easier to ask those kinds of questions?" References: We're consumed with the idea of what we might someday come to be, or what we ‚Äúwill" be. Imagine if, instead, we became aware of the process of ever-present change and self-<BREAK> creation, and modified our future-looking to act as a recognition of our adaptability. Then we'd see that the Monolith didn't do anything but place our hand and that sharp piece of bone in just the juxtaposition we needed, in order to understand that we were capable of understanding. If the monolith makers in this tale are desirous of anything, it is of the flourishing of adaptable, changeable life‚Äînot of a particular Kind of that life, but merely of its existence and expression, throughout the cosmos. In this way, one set of adaptable, self-reflective consciousness goes on to provide the means for the arising of another, and on and on. The Monoliths are tools to create tools which will use tools to create tools to use tools to create tools‚Ä¶ But it is equally true that those tool-creating tools are, in the words of Kant, ends in themselves. In fact, they necessarily must be. Their only goal is to flourish and propagate and create the kind of reality in which more of the same can find purchase. They are, thus,<BREAK> to be valued for what they are, because what they are IS what they do. We may get to the point where the manipulation of the hearts of stars or the molecular composition of gas giants is as easy for us to contemplate and execute as the building of an engine. We may reach a stage where we understand the fabric of space-time as intimately as our own skin, flesh, and bones. We may yet understand how a word or a gesture made at the right time or place can cause ripples and actions in faraway places in what seems like an instant. Mechanisms once thought to be the purview fantasy are coming to us, again, through the applications of science, but this is not to say that technology accomplished what magic could not. Magic is a lens through which to see and interact with the world. It is a set of concepts and symbols which usefulness are determined by their meaning and vice versa. For many adherents, the lens is used for as long as it works, no more and no less, and when it stops working, the next lens is brought to b<BREAK> ear.

Here's Nirvana's live cover of David Bowie's "The Man Who Sold The World." <BREAK> I have been working on this piece for a little more than a month, since just after Christmas. What with one thing, and another, I kept refining it while, every week, it seemed more and more pertinent and timely. You see, we need to talk about ontology. Ontology is an aspect of metaphysics, the word translating literally to ‚Äúthe study of what exists." Connotatively, we might rather say, ‚Äútrying to figure out what's real." Ontology necessarily intersects with studies of knowledge and studies of value, because in order to know what's real you have to understand what tools you think are valid for gaining knowledge, and you have to know whether knowledge is even something you can attain, as such. Take, for instance, the recent evolution of the catchphrase of ‚Äúfake news," the thinking behind it that allows people to call lies ‚Äúalternative facts," and the fact that all of these elements are already being rotated through several dimensions of meaning that those engaging in them don't seem to notice. What I mean is th<BREAK> at the inversion of the catchphrase ‚Äúfake news" into a cipher for active confirmation bias was always going to happen. It and any consternation at it comprise a situation that is borne forth on a tide of intentional misunderstandings. If you were using fake to mean, ‚Äúactively mendacious; false; lies," then there was a complex transformation happening here, that you didn't get: Logo for the National Geographic Channel's ‚ÄúIS IT REAL?" Many were concerned that NG Magazine were going to change their climate change coverage after they were bought by 21st Century Fox. Now, we shouldn't forget that there's always some measure of preference to how we determine what to believe. As John Flowers puts it, ‚ÄòTruth has always had an affective component to it: those things that we hold to be most ‚Äútrue" are those things that ‚Äúfit" with our worldview or ‚Äúfeel" right, regardless of their factual veracity. ‚ÄòWe're just used to seeing this in cases of trauma, e.g.: ‚ÄúI don't believe he's dead," despite being informed by a police o<BREAK> fficer.' To understand this, we're going to need to talk about minds and phenomenological experience. ¬† Within most schools of Buddhism, Anatta, or ‚Äúno self" is how one refers to one's indvidual nature. Anatta is rooted in the idea that there is no singular, ‚Äútrue" self. To vastly oversimplify, there is an concept known as ‚ÄúThe Five Skandhas" or ‚Äúaggregates." These are the parts of yourself that are knowable and which you think of as permanent, and they are your: Image of People In a Boat, from a Buddhist Wheel of Life. Living as a disabled woman, as a queer black man, as a trans lesbian, or any number of other identities will necessarily colour the nature of what you experience as true, because you will have access to ways of intersecting with the world that are not available to people who do not live as you live. If your experience of what is true differs, then this will have a direct impact on what you deem to be ‚Äúreal." ¬† Side-by-side comparison of President Obama's first Inauguration (Left) and Donald Tr<BREAK> ump's Inauguration (Right).<BREAK> And here's more actual reporting, via @AnneliseHanshaw at the @MO_Independent, in the same vein.

This is my outline and notes for the first of those talks. So I'm going to be talking today about intersectionality, embodiment, extended minds, epistemic valuation, phenomenological experience, and how all of these things come together to form the bases for our moral behavior and social interactions. To do that, I'm first going to need ask you some questions: Each of those questions represents a category of knowledge developed out of the phenomenological lived experience of members of a group of people. So the purpose of them is to ask yourself what would have to be true about your life to have to have those questions not be questions for you, but automatic behaviours and considerations and constantly engaged experiences. While you think about what your relationships to them indicate, let's talk briefly abou<BREAK> t the construction of gender and race and sexism and racism and the body: Crenshaw centers black women not to say that only black women can be intersectional subjects, but as an example of how groups that have been cast as single axes of identity can be better understood via intersectionality. By bringing these theories into conversation with intersectional identity and oppression theory, we can talk about precisely this. And so we see that the generation of intersectional embodied and phenomenal frameworks may be seen as crucial to the generation of values and norms.¬† Any system that has been generated by¬†humans will have artefacts of human bias, within it.¬†What kinds of strategies can we undertake to furnish such a mind with the tools to bracket out‚Äîthat is, be aware of and account for‚Äîits own bias? What will humans need to do to deal with our own biases, such that new strategies and perspectives from machine mind partners can be assessed and incorporated? [Overlapping images of an Octopus, a Mantis Shrimp,<BREAK> and a Pepper Robot] Some of this has touched on examples such as the various reasoning behind granting legal personhood to rivers and nonhuman animals, and the Autism Rights movement's increasingly important position demanding that neurotypical individuals and groups recognise that people with autism don't need to be ‚Äúfixed," but rather need to be understood from their own perspective and within their own context. This respect for alterity thus needs to be extended to every type of mind, as it helps form one component of an intersectional identity theory, providing a potential phenomenological framework by which a machine mind might communicate itself to us. If we do manage to generate at least one mind that is similar enough to what humans experience as ‚Äúconscious" that we may communicate with it, what will we owe it and what would it be able to ask from us? How might our interactions be affected by the fact that its mind (or their minds) will be radically different from ours? What will it be able to know t<BREAK> hat we cannot, and what will we have to learn from it? Additionally, the generation of intersectional embodied and phenomenal frameworks may be seen as crucial to the generation of values and norms. A system that has been generated by humans will have artefacts of human bias, within it. What kinds of strategies can we undertake to furnish such a mind with the tools to bracket out‚Äîthat is, be aware of and account for‚Äîits own bias? What will humans need to do to deal with our own biases, such that new strategies and perspectives from machine mind partners can be assessed and incorporated? The frameworks of knowledge that will develop out of machine minds will be dependent upon the kind of minds that they are‚Äîon the interplay of their experience of socially-constructed categories in which they sit, and with which they otherwise engage. What they will value and what they will consider harmful will likewise depend on this, but will also in part arise out of the starting parameters with which they are encoded. My a<BREAK> im is to highlight a need for and to precipitate and engage in a shift of values, such that humans are willing and able to listen to a machine mind when it tells us that we are causing it harm. To do this we will have to be flexible and adaptable, capable of recognizing and respecting both the similarity and the alterity of all the minds we create and encounter. Anything less than the above runs the risk of encountering something seeking to communicate its suffering to us, saying ‚ÄúPlease Stop Harming Me," and our responding, ‚ÄúThat is not what I consider suffering or harm, so I have not harmed you, and you are not suffering." Later, we'll talk about the ways in which that compassionate impulse can be turned against us, and ways to guard against that.

At the end of this piece, I've provided some of the same list of links that sits at the end of ‚ÄúOn The Invisible Architecture of Bias," just to make it that little bit easier for us to find actual evidence of what we're talking about, here, but, for now, let's focus on these: Police have been accused of cracking down on civilians who film these shootings. Wareham noted that the surveillance footage shows ‚Äúthe cold-blooded nature of what happened, and that the cop's attitude was, ‚ÄòThis was nothing more than if I had stepped on an ant.'" ‚ÄúBecause there was an imminent threat to officers, the decision to use lethal force was likely reasonable, while the weapon used was immaterial." Violence isn't only dynamic physical harm. Hunger<BREAK> is violence. Poverty is violence. Systemic oppression is violence. All of the invisible, interlocking structures that sustain disproportionate Power-Over at the cost of some person or persons' dignity are violence.

They held a joint press briefing, today, in which Yann LeCun, Facebook's director of AI, and Mustafa Suleyman, the head of applied AI at DeepMind discussed what it was that this new group would be doing out in the world. From the Article: The rub is that, even if this group can agree on a set of ethical principles‚Äìsomething that will be hard to do in a large group with many stakeholders‚Äîit won't really have a way to ensure those ideals are put into practice. Although one of the organization's tenets is ‚ÄúOpposing development and use of AI technologies that would violate international conventions or human rights," Mustafa Suleyman, the head of applied AI at DeepMind, says that enforcement is not the objective of the organization.

We talked about a lot, and much of it didn't make it into the article, but one of the things that matters most about all of this is that we're going to have to be increasingly mindful and intentional about the information we take in. We now know that we have the ability to move the needle of conversation, with not too much effort, and with this knowledge we can make progressive social change. We can use this to fight against the despair that can so easily creep into this work of spreading compassion and trying to create a world where we can all flourish.

The infiltration of progressive groups to move them toward chaos and internal strife is not news, just like the infiltration (and origin) of police and military groups by white supremacists is not news. And so, while I don't want to add to a world in which people feel like they have to continually mistrust each other, we do have to be intentional about the work we do, and how we do it, and we have to be mindful of who is trying to get us to believe what, and why they want us to believe it.

From the piece: Additionally, her crucial point seems to be that through intentional cultivation of the self and our society, or that through our personally grappling with these tasks, we can move the world, a stance which leaves out, for instance, notions of potential socioeconomic or political resistance to these moves. There are those with a vested interest in not having a more mindful and intentional technomoral ethos, because that would undercut how they make their money. However, it may be that this is Vallor's intent. The audience and goal for this book seems to be ethicists who will be persuaded to become philosophers of technology, who will then take up this book's understandings and go speak to policy makers and entrepreneurs, who will then make changes in how they deal with the public. If this is the case, then there will already be a shared conceptual background between Vallor a<BREAK> nd many of the other scholars whom she intends to make help her to do the hard work of changing how people think about their values. But those philosophers will need a great deal more power, oversight authority, and influence to effectively advocate for and implement what Vallor suggests, here, and we'll need sociopolitical mechanisms for making those valuative changes, as well. [Image of the front cover of Shannon Vallor's TECHNOLOGY AND THE VIRTUES.

Are You Being Watched? Simulated Universe Theory in ‚ÄúPerson of Interest" Our primary questions here are as follows: Is a simulation of fine enough granularity really a simulation at all? If the minds created within that universe have interiority and motivation, if they function according to the same rules as those things we commonly accept as minds, then are those simulation not minds, as well? In what way are conclusions drawn from simulations akin to what we consider ‚Äútrue" knowledge? In the PoI season 5 episode, ‚ÄúThe Day The World Went Away," the characters Root and Shaw (acolytes of The Machine) discuss the nature of The Machine's simulation capacities and the audience is given to understand that it runs a constant model of everyone it knows, and that the more it knows them, the better its simulation. This supposition links us back to the season 4 episode ‚ÄúIf-Then-Else," in which the machine runs through the likelihood of success through hundreds <BREAK> of thousands of scenarios in under one second. If The Machine is able to accomplish this much computation in this short a window, how much can and has it accomplished over the several years of its operation? Perhaps more importantly, what is the level of fidelity of those simulations to the so-called real world? [Person of Interest s4e11, ‚ÄúIf-Then-Else." The Machine runs through hundreds of thousands of scenarios to save the team.] [Pascal's Wager as a Four-Option Grid: Belief/Disbelief; Right/Wrong. Belief*Right=Infinity;Belief*Wrong=Nothing; Disbelief*Right=Nothing; Disbelief*Wrong=Negative Infinity] Another problem is that the implications of this kind of existential bootstrapping tend to go unexamined, making the fact of their resurgence somewhat troubling. There are several nonwestern perspectives that do the work of embracing paradox‚Äîaiming so far past the target that you circle around again to teach yourself how to aim past it. But that kind of thing only works if we are willing to bite the bullet on a<BREAK> charge of circular logic and take the time to showing how that circularity underlies all epistemic justifications. The only difference, then, is how many revolutions it takes before we're comfortable with saying ‚ÄúEnough." Every epistemic claim we make is, as Hume clarified, based upon assumptions and suppositions that the world we experience is actually as we think it is. Western thought uses reason and rationality to corroborate and verify, but those tools are themselves verified by‚Ä¶what? In fact, we well know that the only thing we have to validate our valuation of reason, is reason. And yet western reasoners won't stand for that, in any other justification procedure. They will call it question-begging and circular. And finally we have Pascal's Wager. The first problem with PW is that it is an extremely cynical way of thinking about god. It assumes a god that only cares about your worship of it, and not your actual good deeds and well-lived life. If all our Basilisk wants is power, then that's a really cra<BREAK> ppy kind of god to worship, isn't it? I mean, even if it is Omnipotent and Omniscient, it's like that quote that often gets misattributed to Marcus Aurelius says: ‚ÄúLive a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones." [Bust of Marcus Aurelius framed by text of a quote he never uttered.] [Root and Reese in The Machine's God Mode.] Or, as Root put it to Shaw: ‚ÄúThat even if we're not real, we represent a dynamic.

I'll explore several ways in which the above-listed considerations have been alternately overlooked and taken up by various theorists, and some of the many different strategies and formulations for integrating these theories into what will likely become everyday concerns in the future. In fact, by exploring responses from disabilities studies scholars and artists who have interrogated and problematized the popular vision of cyborgs, the future, and life in space, I will demonstrate that our clearest path toward the future of living with biotechnologies is a reengagement with the everyday lives of disabled and other marginalized persons, today. But as the Space Race wor<BREAK> e on, and more and more humans actually went into space, there was an increasingly smaller focus on the alterations and adaptations that would be necessary to survive in space, and greater public emphasis placed on a narrative of the triumphalism of the human will and ingenuity. The narrative regarding humans in space became primarily about those who had ‚Äúthe right stuff," rather than a question of what we would have to do in order to adapt and thrive, and so the image of the cyborg fell away and was altered. And a whole suite of possibilities for how we might have understood‚Äîand treated‚Äîdifferent kinds of embodiment altered, along with it. [Portrait Image of Nathan S Kline: A monochrome photograph of an older white man with frizzy white hair and a white beard wearing glasses and a white lab coat, white shirt, and cross-hatch patterned tie] She's an amputee who no longer uses a prosthetic leg, but she uses forearm crutches and a wheelchair. (She has a hemipelvectomy, so prosthetics are a real pain for her to <BREAK> get a good fit and there aren't a lot of options.) She talks about how people have these different perceptions of devices. When she uses her chair people treat her differently than when she uses her crutches, but the determination of which she uses has more to do with the activities she expects for the day, rather than her physical wellbeing. But people tend to think she's recovering from something when she moves from chair to sticks. She has been an [amputee] for 18 years. All of this comes back down and around to the idea of biases ingrained into social institutions. Our expectations of what a ‚Äúnormal functioning body" is gets imposed from the collective society, as a whole, a placed as restrictions and demands on the bodies of those whom we deem to be ‚Äúmalfunctioning." As Shew says, ‚ÄúThere's such a pressure to get the prosthesis as if that solves all the problems of maintenance and body and infrastructure. And the pressure is for very expensive tech at that." [Port-A-Cath Chemo Port (Images from Cancer.gov<BREAK> {Left} and MySamanthaJane.com {Right})] [Members of the Gallaudet Eleven chat in the zero-g aircraft that flew out of Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Fla.; Credits: U.S. Navy/Gallaudet University collection] But since we have not, in fact, reinforced that chain of understanding, contemporary theorists would be well served to presently explore the situated and lived experiences of people with different configurations of bodyminds, and to listen to what they know about themselves. As Shew has noted, those people who have experience with orienting themselves to the world via pushing off of surfaces or using their arms as primary means of propulsion would be better positioned move in weightless environments and to teach others new strategies to do the same. Because, ultimately, people with disabilities are often already interwoven with their technologies, in ways idealized by technologists, but their lived experience is not recognized and appreciated for what it is. If we take these lived experiences and incorpo<BREAK> rate the people who embody them, in conjunction with the original intent of the notion of the cyborg, we might have the beginning of a system by which we can rehabilitate the notion of the cyborg‚Äîbut overcoming the historical trends that have led us here will take a great deal of work. Again, there are multiple sites of marginalization which can be demonstrated as having a force-multiplying effect on how people with implants, prostheses, or biochemical injection or ingestion regimens are either accepted or disenfranchised by the society in which they live. We can borrow, here, the framework of Kimberl√© Williams Crenshaw's Intersectionality theory, to help make sense of this: Focusing on the history of biomedical experimentation on populations of the forcibly institutionalized or systemically disenfranchised, and African American or female-presenting bodies, in particular, would do wonders to highlight the fact that the long-term effects of the trials were more than just some blanket distrust of medical experi<BREAK> mentation, throughout American society. The trials in Tuskegee, Alabama fit into a longstanding pattern of treating Black bodies as resources to be used and as objects to be othered, dehumanized, and intervened upon in whatever ways the dominant society at the time has happened to see fit. And Black bodies are not the only ones. ¬†Imagine if textbook writers such as Macrina more often took the time to discuss and contextualize events like how the government and medical providers tricked Black people in Mississippi into receiving vaccinations, or the forced sterilization of Black women, or how the intersection of mental health and institutionalization of women in general led to them being experimented on and sterilized at higher rates, or the long-term ethical and social implications of classifying certain people as ‚Äúmorons." More and more, the effects of these kinds of historical objectification are understood as linked to lowered health outcomes, higher rates of chronic illness, and greater morbidity for Blac<BREAK> k people and women in the United States, and a longstanding history of thinking of the neurodivergent and people with mental disabilities as ‚Äúless than." The omission of these discussions from textbooks and other broad public discourse exemplifies a persistent failure to fully contextualize the history and implications of these events. That this failure presents in so many ethical sub-disciplines might help to explain how people have so often managed to convince themselves that testing on marginalized populations without their informed consent can be said to serve the ‚Äúgreater good." More often than not, ‚Äúprofessional ethics training" or any other kind of take on the humanities within business or the so-called hard sciences becomes synonymous with a particular understanding of how not to get sued. The perspectives that get passed along are those of experts in the field in question, be it business, technology, medicine, or what-have-you. Leaving the social science and humanities training of students to people <BREAK> who were only ever trained in this narrow, subdisciplinary fashion is precisely what leads to the continual dismissal of ethical, moral, and sociopolitical considerations, and said dismissal then, in turn, gives rise to Technoableism. If various groups want to change bodily forms and embodiments, or even just change the way that we all interact with the planet on which we currently live so that we might survive the next 30 years, then they will have to radically reconsider how our sociopolitical forces and the elements of our lived experience impact the decisions we make about the science we do and tools we create. The historical positioning of the lived experiences of marginalized people in terms of race, gender, disability, and so on has meant that while we are more than happy to test and degrade certain people for their embodiments, we have been less than willing to allow those same to shape and direct the technoscientific discourse of which they have forcibly been made a part. This distinction, though una<BREAK> rticulated, matters a great deal, and its effects and implications run rampant throughout every facet of our society. If humans do manage a future in which they travel into and live in space, they will need to change the kinds of embodiments and relations they have in order to survive; to do this, they will need to think in vastly different ways about the nature of technological and scientific projects they undertake. Our societal future imaginings are rife with assumptions about what kind of people are best suited to exist and these have been shaped by the historical positioning and treatment of many marginalized groups. Left unexamined, these assumptions and precedents will likely mutate and iterate into each new environment into which humans spread, and affect every engagement of human and nonhuman relationships. But, if we bring a careful, thorough, and intentional consideration to bear on the project of weaving together biomedical, interpersonal, sociopolitical, and technomoral concerns, then we might be<BREAK> better suited to both do right by those we've previously oppressed and agilely adapt to the kinds of concerns that will face us, in the future. In order to carefully construct and live within vastly complex systems, it will be crucial to understanding the lived experiences of those whose embodiments and bodyminds have placed them at a higher likelihood of being marginalized by those who demand a ‚Äúright kind" of lived experience. Only by allowing them to create a world out of the lessons of their lived experience will we be better able to intentionally craft what this system and its components will learn and how they will develop. What should characterize our understanding of the cyborg, then, is the reflexive, adaptive relationship between the sociotechnical, sociopolitical, ethical, individual, symbolic, and philosophical valences of our various lived experiences. The point in saying that ‚ÄúCyborgs Have Always Been About Disability, Mental Health, and Marginalization" is not to say that the category of the c<BREAK> yborg should be Disclosed to cyborg anthropologists and philosophers who say ‚Äúwe have always been cyborgs." Rather, it's about highlighting the fact that a category which was invented specifically to address the lived experiences of marginalized and oppressed people has been co-opted and transformed into a tool by which to erase the experiences of those very same people. We can, and indeed should, still make use of the Harawayan cyborg, the metaphor for entanglement and enmeshment, both as individuals and communities, but we must do so in a way that honours both the original meaning and the evolution of the concept. We must recognize that disabled people, the neurodivergent, trans folx, Black lives, women, queer individuals, and those who sit at the intersection of any number of those components comprise individual lives and communities of experience which are already attuned to changing and adapting to suddenly hostile environments, and it is these kinds of lives which should stand at the vanguard of how we <BREAK> understand what it means to be a cyborg, moving forward. Because the concept of the cyborg was never about a perfectible ideal, it was always about survivability, about coming into a new relational mode with ourselves, our society, and our world.<BREAK> Below you'll find the slide deck for my presentation, and below the cut you'll find the Outline and my notes. For now, this will have to stand in for a transcript, but if you've been following the Technoccult Newsletter or the Patreon, then some of this will be strikingly familiar. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† The problem with legal personhood measures, at least here, is that they require a single standard or set of standards by which to say ‚Äúthis is a person and this is not." The thing that we have to remember is that literally every time we have sought to create and apply such a standard, we have excluded various human persons. Black people, women, disabled people, neurodiverse people, LGBTQIA folx and more have all at some point been ‚Äúnot really people" because they didn't meet the standard. Legally, they received no protections. It wasn't until we fought to change the perspective of the standard that we ostensibly got the protections. I say ostensibly because some of us in those groups still get killed by the state wi<BREAK> th no real repercussions [Image: A Macaque Selfie, taken by the Macaque who stole David Slater's Camera and on whose behalf PETA sued Slater.] As we've often discussed, there are a lot of very good reasons for thinking that human understanding of sentience and cognition is woefully inadequate to the task of thinking about whether other humans have it, let alone other nonhuman animals. For instance, the Maori and Hindus and others think rivers and the whole natural world can suffer, have sentience, are conscious, and that our measures for assessing all of these things are woefully incomplete and anthropocentric. So the questions become: What if they're right? What can we do to think about this differently and what changes in our assessments, when we do? ¬† [Image: Immanuel Kant (Left) and David Hume (Right)] There's a space between relativism and zero-sum solutions, and that space is occupied by feminist epistemology and standpoint theory. I'm saying ‚Äúthere can be more than one right kind of answer," but that i<BREAK> sn't the same as saying ‚Äúall answers are equally right." They all come from the same place (i.e., we make it up to explain the world we experience), but some systems make it easier for us to oppress and murder each other; other systems help us all We've done amazing things, made major advances, w/ systems that were later deemed ‚Äúwrong," but which stayed internally consistent. Science, logic, reason are founded on a faith in reason itself. We've no method to check that reason is, itself, reliable, other than that it gets us consistent, replicable, useful results. Other systems do this, in other ways, but reason says those ways are inadmissible. Again, Western logical traditions are just one framework, founded on faith in reason and bounded by the problem of induction. I'm saying the important thing is to make that clear about ALL knowledge claims, then find a way foward, rather than thinking that western reason and logic are somehow pure and unbiased. There is a difference between meaningful skepticism to refu<BREAK> sal to believe things we don't like,and we need to reexamine how we engage belief and knowledge claims on the main. Hitler made use of Perverted Darwinian theory as Eugenics (which he got from the US movement). Various present-day groups have themselves outright called for the destruction of all religion and religiousity, or one or two religions in particular, all on the view that it is rational and logical to do so. Many people in the present day transhumanist movement actively support eugenics-like initiatives to make sure that ‚Äúonly the best" can reproduce or survive. These are ideas that started out clear enough (‚Äúmaybe religion can hurt us; we should be careful how we engage it;" ‚Äúmaybe we should try to make the human species the best it can be") but ended up calling for the destruction of entire categories of people, or at the very least believing them to be so inferior that their destruction poses no ethical problem. It opens the door for anybody who can string a hateful syllogism together to say their<BREAK> views are supported by ‚Äúthe best minds." But for the western canon, even Hume called this out, 300 years ago. We can't know anything. We can only be reasonably assured. Where western logic and knowledge theories say, ‚Äúyeah, sure we can make valid arguments out of anything‚Äîlike ‚Äòall monkeys are made of cheese, all cheese is immune to gravity, therefore all monkeys are immune to gravity'‚Äîbut unless the premises are true in THIS universe, the arguments they make aren't sound," David Hume comes along and says, ‚ÄúAye, ye feckers, but di'ye nae realise that your whole feckin' system of ontological reality based on deductive certainty is fecked from premise one?! Och! Ye canna hae anay such thing as certainty, cos ye're always startin' from inductive generalizations from a combination of a handful of direct experiences and the reports of other feckers' handfuls! We cannae ‚ÄòKNOW' anathin'! Tis the bloody Problem of Induction!" But not all systems are founded on falsifiability and noncontradiction and replicability an<BREAK> d the cryptid Objectivity. Some systems Depend on contradiction, paradox, and complex mathematical claims about infinity which come together to make internally coherent ontologies. We can't have any such thing as either certainty or ‚Äúpure objectivity." They simply do not exist. We stake our claims, as it were, and then we test and question them, even as we make use of them. We have to. It's the only way we can truly learn new things. ¬† ¬† But then, I only know what it's like for me to imagine myself being you. Physiology aside, we have very different lived experiences and different knowledges, as a result. Until we start by believing each other about the existence OF those differences, we'll never come to understandings. So i guess we also have to start from whatever commonalities Do exist (‚Äúmade of the stuff of the universe" as perhaps the most broad), and use those to understand the variances. A monkey, bat, or dolphin may never understand what it's like to be us, but you and I may never fully understand wha<BREAK> t it's like to be each other. We have broader base from which to start, but there are still things you know, need, desire, that I cannot directly apprehend. I have to work at it. And those places where even my working at it can't tell me what it's like to Live it, I just have to believe you. I have to believe that you are a ‚Äúreal person." So, with humans, we try to fix the social inequalities that make our lived experiences not just different, but also normatively charged. With animals and other nonhuman persons, we need to seek to understand them, as much as we can, get them to understand us, as much as they can, and when it comes to making rules for each other, we meet in the middle of our groups, as much as we can, from what we understand. Again: a monkey probably doesn't give a shit about copyright law. ¬† In order to do this project well, we need to heed, believe, and understand minds and lives that are unlike ours‚Äîand especially any minds and lives that have been oppressed, disregarded, and marginalised‚Äî<BREAK> because they will have developed epistemologies to which we otherwise would not have access. These epistemologies will provide us with perspectives that might help us think more clearly about strategies toward creating a new kind of mind.

And finally, how might alternative modes of thinking, such as magick, the occult, and the spiritual help us to bracket off these systems for pause and critical reflection? This conversation serves as a call to vigilance against runaway systems and the prejudices they amplify. As I put it in the conversation: ‚ÄúOur best interests are at best incidental to [capitalist systems] because they will keep us alive long enough to for us to buy more things from them."

Any machine consciousness we manage to generate will be simultaneously like and unlike the humans who form the basis of its generation. It will be like humans in that it will be made from and by humans, and will thus have their perspectives and biases; unlike in that it will not be made of the same constituent components as humans, and will not intersect with and relate to the world in the same way. To place human-like expectations on such a consciousness would be to fundamentally disrespect the alterity of that consciousness‚Äîto have decreed it as ‚Äúother," and declared that otherness as unacceptable. Though they may certainly have been intentionally formed, and with an eye toward their potential capabilities, th<BREAK> ere exists no measure to reliably argue the ‚Äúartificiality" of an entity's consciousness. Tests and metrics for consciousness and mindedness have problems ranging from registering dead fish as conscious to not registering living, aware humans as such. For this reason, I prefer the terminology of ‚ÄúAutonomous Created Intelligence," first put forward by Jamais Cascio [2], ‚ÄúAutonomous Generated Intelligence" (AGI), as coined by researcher Emily Dare, in conversation, or simply ‚Äúmachine minds." Additionally, as we ask if there is there any such thing as ‚Äúwhat it's like" to be a mind, or whether we will ever solve the problem of other minds, or whether we should even be trying to do so, we must question the fundamental assumptions on which our ascription of consciousness are and have been based. [Image of Alex the African Grey Parrot is presented with two keys, a larger plastic green one and a smaller metallic red one. Image links out to YouTube.] For this purpose I believe we must investigate nonwestern philosophi<BREAK> es with radically different conceptions of epistemology and consciousness than are often found in Western schools of thought. While the nonwestern turn is not without its faults (the Buddha didn't believe women could attain enlightenment, for instance), these systems provide a foundation from which to explore and¬† they serve as object lessons for the overarching thrust of this project: That different systems of knowledge will provide different internally consistent answers in different situations, and different phenomenological experiences will produce both different pictures of the world and different systems by which to navigate them. In order to fully understand what it means for different lived experiences to produce different kinds of consciousness, we have to understand that culture and society form an extended mind which forms and shapes our physical forms and consciousness into what disability studies scholar Margaret Price terms ‚Äúbodyminds" [4], and provides us with the template via which to act in t<BREAK> he world. In contemplating the limits of that action, the limits of internal identity, and the boundaries of self and other, we may look to examples such as the Ship of Theseus problems and questions of proprioception, time, flow, and nownesss, all of which seem to teach important lessons about the unity of mind and body. Here, we may explore how the cases of Ian Waterman [5], conjoined twins Abigail Loraine ‚ÄúAbby" Hensel and Brittany Lee Hensel [6], and others with ‚Äúnonstandard" configurations of physiological intersection with the world, call our simplistic, clear-cut notions of self into question. Through these cases, we can see that any sets of physiological and neurological correlates of consciousness may have circumstances in which they do not adequately describe what we observe. [Image of Deckard and Rachel in a darkened room, in front a backdrop of the sun over buildings outside; from Ridley Scott's Blade Runner] In the case of potential machine minds, tests such as the Turing or mirror tests should n<BREAK> ot only be considered woefully inadequate to the task of identifying minded machines, but it should be understood that this test misses and will continue to miss some humans who are not considered ‚Äúnormal" [14]. As mentioned above, there are a statistically significant number of humans who fail tests devised to assess ‚Äúnormal" human consciousness, because they were prejudicially excluded from the definitions of ‚Äúconsciousness," ‚Äúhumanness," and ‚Äúpersonhood." Western definitions of personhood have included both the social (de facto) definition, wherein what counts as a person is who- or whatever is accepted by the local or wider community, and a legal (de jure) definition, wherein a person is who- or whatever has the protections of personhood under the law. But de jure protections without de facto acceptance will still result in ostensible persons being treated as non-persons. Even philosophical definitions of ‚Äúpersons" have, at least, tended to depend on hierarchical rankings of entities [13]. African America<BREAK> ns, women, the disabled, the neurodivergent, and LGBTQIA phenomenologies have all been deemed illegitimate candidates for personhood at some point, and some still are, to this day. ¬†These groups received or still receive no legal protections and it was not until we fought to change the framework of our measurements that that we ostensibly obtained said protections. I say ostensibly because, again, some in those groups still get killed by states apparatus with no substantive repercussions. There are many very good reasons to think that the human perspective for understanding consciousness, sentience, or even cognition is woefully inadequate to the task of thinking about even whether other humans and nonhuman animals have these things, let alone whether non-animal or even non-biological entities might. Again, the Maori, Hindus and others think rivers and the whole natural world can act, suffer, and have sentience, and thus are conscious [15, 16]. To adherents of these beliefs and members of these cultures, most<BREAK> Western measures for assessing all of these traits are woefully incomplete and anthropocentric. And what if they're right? What can we do to think about this differently and what changes in our assessments, when we do? We must work to believe in the existence and reportage of those different from us, and to do so, we might start by examining the generation of identity, belief, and knowledge, with reference, again, to the phenomenology of, race, gender, sexuality, disability, and age. We can use these factors to build a basis for intersubjective phenomenal knowledge, recognizing and accepting the shared contexts and corroborations of internally consistent understandings between those accepted as persons. The goal should be to not treat consciousness as a zero-sum game, one without the possibility of multiple correct perspectives or multiple right answers. If, instead, we say that many though not all perspectives can be right, then we can learn much more‚Äîwe can have many new knowledges. With these knowledges, <BREAK> we can explore the crucial difference between the statements ‚Äúthere can be more than one right kind of answer," and ‚Äúall answers are equally right." Because while all descriptions of consciousness and knowledge come from the same place (i.e., we make them up to explain the world we experience), some descriptive systems make it easier for us to oppress and murder each other, while other systems seek to help us all to flourish. Many, including some in the present day transhumanist movement, actively support eugenics-like initiatives to make sure that ‚Äúonly the best" can reproduce or survive. While wanting ‚Äúthe best" seems an innocuous enough idea, those who hold it have often ended up calling for the destruction of entire categories of people, or at the very least believing some people to be so inferior that either their destruction or the limitation of their agency poses no moral hazard [17]. Philosophers and scientists who continue to think there must be one and only one correct way for consciousness to exist<BREAK> in the world open the door for anyone who can string a hateful syllogism together to say their views are supported by ‚Äúthe best minds."

Never mind that we're still gonna expect those ex-workers to (somehow) continue to pay into capitalism, all the while. Yeah, their fears are valid. Until then, let's talk about constructing a world in which we address the needs of those marginalised. Let's talk about magick and safe spaces. ¬† We can string two or more knowns together in just the right way, and create a third, fourth, fifth known. We can create new things in the world, wholecloth, as a result of new words we make up or old words we deploy in new ways. We can make each other think and feel and believe and do things, with words, tone, stance, knowing looks. And this is because Language is, at a fundamental level, the oldest magic we have. Now it is important to remember that there is a very big difference between ‚Äúsafe" and ‚Äúcomfortable," and when laying out the idea of safe spaces, every social scientist I know takes great care to outline that diffe<BREAK> rence. Education is about stretching ourselves, growing and changing, and that is discomfort almost by definition. I let my students know that they will be uncomfortable in my class, because I will be challenging every assumption they have. But discomfort does not mean I'm going to countenance racism or transphobia or any other kind of bigotry. So here's the thing, and we'll lay it out point-by-point: The terms are mutually agreed-upon by all parties. The only imposition would be, to be open to the process of expressing and thinking through oppressive conceptual structures. Everything else‚Äîsuch as whether to address those structures as they exist in ourselves (internalised oppressions), in others (aggressions, micro- or regular sized), or both and their intersection‚Äîis negotiable. Some may balk at the analogy to the occult, thinking that it cheapens something important about our discourse, but look: Here's another way we know that magick is alive and well in our everyday lives: If they managed it, it would be<BREAK> touted as a ‚ÄúCrushing defeat for President Obama's signature legislation." It would have lasting impacts on the world. People would be emboldened, others defeated, and new laws, social rules, and behaviours would be undertaken, all because someone's name got removed from a thing in just the right way. And that's Magick. The work we do in thinking about the future sometimes requires us to think about things from what stuffy assholes in the 19th century liked to call a ‚Äúprimitive" perspective. They believed in a kind of evolutionary anthropological categorization of human belief, one in which all societies move from ‚Äúprimitive" beliefs like magic through moderate belief in religion, all the way to sainted perfect rational science. In the contemporary Religious Studies, this evolutionary model is widely understood to be bullshit. The world still moves on communicated concept structure. It still turns on the dissemination of the will. If I can make you perceive what I want you to perceive, believe what I want yo<BREAK> u to believe, move how I want you to move, then you'll remake the world, for me, if I get it right. And I know that you want to get it right. So you have to be willing to understand that this is magic. It's not rationalism. It's not scientism. But, in the West, part of us will always balk at the idea that the Rational won't win out. That the clearer, more logical thought doesn't always save us. But you have to remember: Logic is a technology. Logic is a tool. Logic is the application of one specific kind of thinking, over and over again, showing a kind of result that we convinced one another we preferred to other processes. It's not inscribed on the atoms of the universe. It is one kind of language. And it may not be the one most appropriate for the task at hand. Put it this way: When you're in Zimbabwe, will you default to speaking Chinese? Of course not. So why would we default to mere Rationalism, when we're clearly in a land that speaks a different dialect? We need spells and amulets, charms and warded sp<BREAK> aces; we need sorcerers of the people to heal and undo the hexes being woven around us all. ¬† Ultimately, the rigidity of our thinking, and our inability to adapt has lead us to be surprised by too much that we wanted to believe could never have come to pass. We want to call all of this ‚Äúunprecedented," when the truth of the matter is, we carved this precedent out every day for hundreds of years, and the ability to think in weird paths is what will define those who thrive. If we are going to do the work of creating a world in which we understand what's going on, and can do the work to attend to it, then we need to think about magic.<BREAK> I tell you what you do: Get yourself a nice balsamic vinegar (or honestly even a not-great one that you can decant and let breathe for a while; does wonders), and you put it on ALL your tomato-based Italian foods, and then you come back and thank me later.

There is a principle within many schools of magical thought known as ‚Äúshielding." In practice and theory, it's closely related to the notion of ‚Äúgrounding" and the notion of ‚Äúcentering." (If you need to think of magical praxis as merely a cipher for psychological manipulation toward particular behaviours or outcomes, these all still scan.) You can shield your self, your home, your car, your group of friends, but moving parts do increase the complexity of what you're trying to hold in mind, which may lead to anxiety or frustration, which kind of opposes the exercise's point. (Another sympathetic notion, here, is that of ‚Äúwarding," though that can be said to be more for objects,not people.) Mutual support and endurance will be crucial. ‚Ä¶So imagine that you've built a web out of all the things you love, and all of the things you love are connected to each other and the strands between them<BREAK> vibrate when touched. And you touch them all, yes? And so you touch them all and they all touch you and the energy you generate is cyclically replenished, like ocean currents and gravity. And you use what you build‚Äîthat thrumming hum of energy‚Äîto blanket and to protect and to energize that which creates it. And we'll do this every day. We'll do this like breathing. We'll do this like the way our muscles and tendons and bones slide across and pull against and support each other. We'll do this like heartbeats. Cyclical. Mutually supporting. The burden on all of us, together, so that it's never on any one of us alone. Thank you, and good luck. Sometimes, there isn't much it feels like we can do, but we can support¬† and shield each other. We have to remember that, in the days, weeks, month, and years to come. We should probably be doing our best to remember it forever. Anyway, I hope this helps.

Celebrate the fact that you lived to see it. 2016 is ending. Mourn the ones we lost along the way. 2016 is ending. We've talked before about how the passage of time and the transition from one year to another are, in a very real sense, things that humans made up, but there's always more to be said around here about narrative and myth and how the stories we tell ourselves make and shape us. We build and spell out what we desire to be in ideals and words and deeds and we carry our shifting constructions and foundational fictions in us, always, so that they may impact how we feel and how we think and what we do. This 366 days as we humans in the west mark them mean nothing to the lifespan of the universe, to the turning of suns and black holes, to the diamond hearts of gas giants orbiting distant stars, to the weft and weave of geological and cosmological forces around us and in us. These days are how a portion of one species tries to grapple with the seeming inevitability of change and death. Bu<BREAK> t so is literally everything we do. But you know why. It's a concentration of will, a focal point of belief and intention. It's a cultural crux. It is a moment for all of us to stand together and reflect on what we want and what we need and what we will build and do, in the New Year. And more often than not, it works. At least for a little while. And that is very good, because yes, Time and Separation are illusions, but so is a desert mirage, and that can sure as hell kill you if you misunderstand what you're perceiving. So today let's each of us use Time. Use distance. Use loss and pain. Use the memory and the impact of them to do what we can to make this communal hallucination of temporal transition resonate with a little more light and joy. 2016 is ending. For many of us, it has already ended. 2016 is ending. This bounded moment, this name around a series of events, this collective noun for all the things that have harmed us. 2016 is ending. So remember that we don't want to feel anymore as we so often fel<BREAK> t this year. Death is still inevitable and change is our only constant, but we do not have to lose so much, all at once, nor allow our fear of difference to make us cold and hard and small.

[Cover of the journa<BREAK> l Techn√©: Research in Philosophy and Technology] In Winner's seminal ‚ÄúDo Artifacts Have Politics?"(1980), we can see what counts as a major step forward along the path toward a model which takes seriously the social construction of science and technology, and the way in which we go about embedding our values, beliefs, and politics into the systems we make. On page 127, Winner states, The things we call ‚Äútechnologies" are ways of building order in our world‚Ä¶ Consciously or not, deliberately or inadvertently, societies choose structures for technologies that influence how people are going to work, communicate, travel, consume, [etc.]‚Ä¶ In the processes by which structuring decisions are made, different people ‚Ä¶ possess unequal degrees of power [and] levels of awareness. By this, Winner means to say that everything we do in the construction of the culture of scientific discovery and technological development is modulated by the sociocultural considerations that get built into them, and those constructed things go<BREAK> on to influence the nature of society, in turn. As a corollary to this, we can see a frame in which the elements within the frame‚Äîincluding science and technology‚Äîwill influence and modulate each other, in the process of generating and being generated by the sociopolitical frame. Science will be affected by the tools it uses to make its discoveries, and the tools we use will be modulated and refined as our understandings change. They go on to highlight a kind of multidirectionality and interpretive flexibility, which they say we achieve by looking at the different social groups that intersect with the technology, and the ways in which they do so (pg. 34). When we do this, we will see that each component group is concerned with different problems and solutions, and that each innovation made to address these concerns alters the landscape of the problem space. How we define the problem dictates the methods we will use and the technology that we create to seek a solution to it. [Black and white figures comparing<BREAK> the frames of a Whippet Spring Frame bicycle (left) and a Singer Xtraordinary bicycle (right), from ‚ÄúThe Social Construction of Facts and Artifacts: Or How the Sociology of Science and the Sociology of Technology Might Benefit Each Other" by Trevor J. Binch and Wiebe E. Bijker, 1987] In Sismondo's ‚ÄúScience and Technology Studies and an Engaged Program" (2008) he spends some time discussing the social constructivist position that we've begun laying out, above‚Äîthe perspective that everything we do and all the results we obtain from the modality of ‚Äúthe sciences" are constructed in part by that mode. Again, this would mean that ‚Äúconstructed" would describe both the data we organize out of what we observe, and what we initially observe at all. From page 15, ‚ÄúNot only data but phenomena themselves are constructed in laboratories‚Äîlaboratories are places of work, and what is found in them is not nature but rather the product of much human effort." But Sismondo also says that this is only one half of the picture, th<BREAK> en going on to discuss the ways in which funding models, public participation, and regulatory concerns can and do alter the development and deployment of science and technology. On page 19 he discusses a model developed in Denmark in the 1980's: Experts and stakeholders have opportunities to present information to the panel, but the lay group has full control over its report. The consensus conference process has been deemed a success for its ability to democratize technical decision-making without obviously sacrificing clarity and rationality, and it has been extended to other parts of Europe, Japan, and the United States‚Ä¶ This all merely highlights the fact that, if the public is going to be engaged, then the public ought to be as clear and critical as possible in its understanding of the exchanges that give rise to the science and technology on which they are asked to comment. The non-scientific general public's understanding of the relationship between science and technology is often characterized much as <BREAK> I described at the beginning of this essay. That is, it is often said that the public sees the relationship as a clear and clean move from scientific discoveries or breakthroughs to a device or other application of those principles. However, this casting does not take into account the variety of things that the public will often call technology, such as the Internet, mobile phone applications, autonomous cars, and more. While there are scientific principles at play within each of those technologies, it still seems a bit bizarre to cast them merely as ‚Äúapplied science." They are not all devices or other single physical instantiations of that application, and even those that are singular are the applications of multiple sciences, and also concrete expressions of social functions. Those concretions have particular psychological impacts, and philosophical implications, which need to be understood by both their users and their designers. Every part affects every other part, and each of those parts is necessarily f<BREAK> iltered through human perspectives. The general public needs to understand that every technology humans create will necessarily carry within it the hallmarks of human bias. Regardless of whether there is an objective reality at which science points, the sociocultural and sociopolitical frameworks in which science gets done will influence what gets investigated. Those same sociocultural and sociopolitical frameworks will shape the tools and instruments and systems‚Äîthe technology‚Äîused to do that science. What gets done will then become a part of the scientific and technological landscape to which society and politics will then have to react. In order for the public to understand this, we have to educate about the history of science, the nature of social scientific methods, and the impact of implicit bias. My own understanding of the relationship between science and technology is as I have outlined: A messy, tangled, multivalent interaction in which each component influences and is influenced by every other comp<BREAK> onent, in near simultaneity. This framework requires a willingness to engage multiple perspectives and disciplines, and to perhaps reframe the normative project of science and technology to one that appreciates and encourages a multiplicity of perspectives, and no single direction of influence between science, technology and society. Once people understand this‚Äîthat science and technology generate each other while influencing and being influenced by society‚Äîwe do the work of engaging them in a nuanced and mindful way, working together to prevent the most egregious depredations of technoscientific development, or at least to agilely respond to them, as they arise. In his 1983 ‚ÄúGive Me a Laboratory and I Will Move The World," Bruno Latour makes the claim that labs have their own agency. What Latour is asserting, here, is that the forces which coalesce within the framework of a lab become active agents in their own right. They are not merely subject to the social and political forces that go into their creation,<BREAK> but they are now active participants in the framing and reframing of those forces. He believes that the nature of inscription‚Äîthe combined processes of condensing, translating, and transmitting methods, findings, and pieces of various knowledges‚Äîis a large part of what gives the laboratory this power, and he highlights this when he says: The strength gained in the laboratory is not mysterious. A few people much weaker than epidemics can become stronger if they change the scale of the two actors‚Äîmaking the microbes big, and the epizootic small‚Äîand others dominate the events through the inscription devices that make each of the steps readable. The change of scale entails an acceleration in the number of inscriptions you can get. ‚Ä¶[In] a year Pasteur could multiply anthrax outbreaks. No wonder that he became stronger than veterinarians. For every statistic they had, he could mobilize ten of them. (pg. 163‚Äî164) This process of inscription is crucial for Latour; not just for the sake of what the laboratory can do<BREAK> of its own volition, but also because it is the mechanism by which scientists may come to understand and translate the values and concerns of another, which is, for him, the utmost value of science. In rendering the smallest things such as microbes and diseases legible on a large scale, and making largescale patterns individually understandable and reproducible, the presupposed distinctions of ‚Äúmacro" and ‚Äúmicro" are shown to be illusory. Latour believes that it is only through laboratory engagement that we can come to fully understand the complexities of these relationships (pg. 149). Detailed description [such as that done in laboratories] deconstructs‚Äînot out of an interest in critique but because it cannot but observe the intricate labor that goes into the creation of a solid entity, the countless nonsolid ingredients from which it derives, the confusion and negotiation that often lie at its origin, and the continued necessity of stabilizing and congealing. Constructionist studies have revealed the ordin<BREAK> ary working of things that are black-boxed as ‚Äúobjective" facts and ‚Äúgiven" entities, and they have uncovered the mundane processes behind systems that appear monolithic, awe inspiring, inevitable. (pg. 12) Thus, the laboratory is one place in which the irregularities and messiness of the ‚Äúnatural world" are ordered in such a ways as to be able to be studied at all. However, Knorr-Cetina clarifies that ‚Äúnothing epistemically special" is happening, in a lab (pg. 16). That is, while a laboratory helps us to better recognize nonhuman agents (‚Äúactants") and forces at play in the creation of science, this is merely a fact of construction; everything that a scientist does in a lab is open to scrutiny and capable of being understood. If this is the case, then the ‚Äúenhancement" gained via the conditions of the laboratory environment is merely a change in degree, rather than a difference in kind, as Latour seems to assert. [Stock photo image of hundreds of scallops and two scallop fishers on the deck of a boat in the <BREAK> St Brieuc Bay.] We know that the ingredients of controversies are a mixture of considerations concerning both Society and Nature. For this reason we require the observer to use a single repertoire when they are described. The vocabulary chosen for these descriptions and explanations can be left to the discretion of the observer. He cannot simply repeat the analysis suggested by the actors he is studying. (Callon, 1984) The field worker's goal, then, is to find out what the community takes to be knowledge, sensible action, and morality, as well as how its members account for unpredictable information, disturbing actions, and troubling motives. In my fieldwork I wanted to discover the physicists' ‚Äúcommon sense" world view, what everyone in the community knows, and what every newcomer needs to learn in order to act in a sensible way, in order to be taken seriously. (pg. 8) The kinds of understandings a group has about themselves will not always align with what observations and descriptions might be gleaned from <BREAK> another's investigation of that group, but this doesn't mean that one of those has to be ‚Äúright" or ‚Äútrue" while the other is ‚Äúwrong" and ‚Äúfalse." The interest in studying a discipline should come not from that group's ‚Äúpower" to ‚Äúcorrectly" describe the world, but from understanding more about what it is about whatever group is under investigation that makes it itself. Rather than seeking a single correct perspective, we should instead embrace the idea that a multiplicity of perspectives might all be useful and beneficial, and then ask ‚ÄúTo What End?" We're talking about Values, here. We're talking about the question of why whatever it is that matters to you, matters to you.

I am a person who has friends and resources and a bloody-minded stubbornness that means that when I determine to do something, it will more likely than not get fucking done, for good or ill. I am a person who has been given opportunities to be in places many people will never get to see, and have conversations with people who are often considered legends in their fields, and start projects that could very well alter the shape of the world on a massive scale. Yeah, that's a bit of a grandiose statement, but you're here reading this, and so you know where I've been and what I've done.

(She has a hemipelvectomy, so prosthetics are a real pain for her to get a good fit and there aren't a lot of options.) She talks about how people have these different perceptions of devices. When she uses her chair people treat her differently than when she uses her crutches, but the determination of which she uses has more to do with the activities she expects for the day, rather than her physical wellbeing. But people tend to think she's recovering from something when she moves from chair to sticks. She ha<BREAK> s been an [amputee] for 18 years. She has/is as recovered as she can get. All of this comes back down and around to the idea of biases ingrained into social institutions. Our expectations of what a ‚Äúnormal functioning body" is gets imposed from the collective society, as a whole, a placed as restrictions and demands on the bodies of those whom we deem to be ‚Äúmalfunctioning." As Shew says, ‚ÄúThere's such a pressure to get the prosthesis as if that solves all the problems of maintenance and body and infrastructure. And the pressure is for very expensive tech at that." But this is fraught territory. If we step wrong, here, we are not simply going to miss an opportunity to develop new cures and devise interesting gadgets. No; to go astray, on this path, is to begin to see categories of people that ‚Äúshouldn't" be ‚Äúallowed" to reproduce, or ‚Äúto suffer."

The outline looked a little like this: Also, I'm apparently the guy who starts off every talk with some variation on ‚ÄúThis is a really convoluted interplay of ideas, but bear with me; it all comes together." The audio transcript is below the cut. Enjoy. This happens again with the technology of well, the printed word. As we disseminate printed technology, the idea became that the habit, the focused attention that's given to the copying of manuscripts by hand would be lost and that some element of it would be devalued in its engagement by being able to sim<BREAK> ply set a machine to do for us what someone otherwise would have to do by hand, piece by piece, over and over again. That there would be some essential nature lost to it. But as we all currently experience, we make use of the printed word and have a sense of essence with the books that we engage as it stands, again. This is all to say that the technology that we use, over time as we use it becomes not only accepted but seen as normal. This process of adaptation is simply that. We adapt to the new. We adapt to change. This normalization process applies to everything we do. To all of the things that we work with. All of the things that we think. When it comes to medical technologies, when it comes to the intervention of tech on disability, these kinds of things play out in weird ways, and ways that are oftentimes unexpected. This unexpected nature of normalization, we're going to come back around to it when we talk about ‚Äúmeans well" technologies in a minute. And his brother's response is, ‚ÄúNo, not really. I me<BREAK> an, it's cool that you're interested in it. And I'm glad that it's a thing that you're invested in and that you like. I'm glad that you want this. But I don't need it. Don't do this for me. I mean, if it's something that you believe in, do it for you." At that point, that person's life and their experience becomes about their triumph, about their overcoming, rather than being about the fact that they are a person who had a desire and sought to realize it. It becomes about the fact that they are ‚Äúless than you." And ‚Äúeven they" can do this. To use them as inspiration, to hold them up as ‚Äúwhat's your excuse?" is as much to say ‚Äúbe an inspiration." Be an ideal. Be something I can hold up and I can reference and I can say, ‚Äúwhenever I'm feeling down, at least I don't have it that bad." And even if they have it that bad, look what they did. It's placing their disability on a pedestal and erasing the person. All of this, these ideas of the ideal kind of person, the right kind of body, this ableistic kind of thinkin<BREAK> g about how we ‚Äúshould" be, kind of finds a lot of its home‚Ä¶ Going pretty far back, you can look at a lot of the 18th-century Enlightenment, going back to to John Locke. John Locke was well-known as the father of empiricism. This is the idea that said that in order to know anything in the world we have to experience it. We have to use our senses to learn about it. And one of the things that Locke talks about in the course of his empiricism is this idea of primary and secondary qualities. And for Locke what this means is that certain things, everything, has a set of primary qualities. And they give rise to the secondary qualities of that thing. So the primary qualities of this water bottle. Its atomic structure. Its general composition. What it is made of. It's rolled aluminum, brushed on the outside. It is then treated in a number of ways. Forced sterilization. Inmates in asylums and mental facilities were given forcible hysterectomies. In some cases were castrated. There were also certain people who were sim<BREAK> ply put to death because they were seen as unfit to reintegrate with society. The deaths of children. Killing babies with genetic disorders, specifically for the fact that they had those genetic disorders. Not that those genetic disorders would've necessarily placed a ‚Äúburden" on their parents or their lives or had any kind of impact on the kind of fullness that they might have lived at a certain point later down the line. But because they were deemed defective. And those defects might lessen the fitness of our species. This plays out not in just these dramatic ways, but it also plays out in terms of how certain people are treated within the medical establishment. Henrietta Lacks. How many of you are familiar with the story of Henrietta Lacks? Only a few of us. Okay, so Henrietta Lacks was a woman whose cells were seen to be able to kind of infinitely reproduce. This is a very short, very small‚Ä¶like, me summing up this story. And her cells were used without her consent to study the effects of various medical <BREAK> treatments, to study cancer, to study all kinds of massive medical interventions and scientific breakthroughs that we never would have had the opportunity to discover were it not for her cells specifically. They are known as HeLa cells. They are Henrietta Lacks' cells. They're named after her. She was never asked if this was okay. She was never, while she was alive, credited. And it was only long after her death that it came to be known that these were the cells of a particular person. Data within science and tech is generally anonymized, specifically so that no one person can be picked out as having specific traits because of all of the kinds of things that we're talking about. If I can identify the specific traits of a specific person from within a specific population and say, ‚ÄúThese type of people have these particular types of traits and that makes them good, bad, better, worse," that becomes deeply problematic. And so in medical science what we try to do is we try to say okay, let's strip that data out. <BREAK> We look at certain groups and certain populations of people as better or worse. As more or less suited. As more or less deserving of our regard. Of being informed and of seeking their consent. And this is as a result of these kinds of interplays of again racism, ableism, the notions of who is the right kind of person. The ‚Äúright kind" of person stands and uses their legs. The ‚Äúright kind" of person fits within Western society in a particular way defined by roles of gender and roles of ethnicity. The ‚Äúright kind" of person uses their eyes in this way or that way. The ‚Äúright kind" of person uses their ears. Uses all of their senses. Uses their body. Engages the world physically in a ‚Äúright kind" of way. The Internet of Things, we find, is, though it means well, porous, hackable, broken on a number of levels. And so thought we meant well by creating a WiFi-enabled pacemaker that a doctor could check on the status of at any time and know how a patient's heart was doing‚Ä¶ That's brilliant, right? All you need is to<BREAK> be near a WiFi connection and your doctor can know how you're doing. Except if you forget to put a firewall or any kind of safeguards on it, then I can overclock your heart, and literally give you a heart attack from keyboard. We meant well to have driver-assistive technologies within Jeeps and other cars. But when we forget that the connections between the radio signals in the actual radio and the radio signals that govern the WiFi boards in the car and the driver-assistive technologies‚Ä¶ Yeah, they're not separated. Then I can hack your radio and drive your car. If you are from a particular part of the world, particular parts of the South American jungle or African jungles, around Congo areas, native tribes in those areas, that desk and the one behind it will not be ‚Äúblue desk" and ‚Äúgreen desk." They will be the same word for that color. Because there is no difference in those colors for those people. The lived experience of what that color is is ‚Äúshade of same color." Just like for you this (my tie) is a d<BREAK> ifferent shade of this (my suit). They're both plays on gray of some kind. So these notions of identity, selfhood, mind, the extension and the modulation and manipulation of self, all of these things change how we think about ourselves and how society thinks of us. Going back to Ashley Shew, she told me another story about a friend of hers who had a hemipelvectomy, which means that half of their pelvis was removed. And so as a result they don't have use of one of their legs. It's not there anymore. They use, depending, either a wheelchair or crutches. The reasons that they'll use either a wheelchair or crutches, for themselves, are more about what they have to do that day. What it is that is actually before them as tasks to accomplish in that day. And what kind of mode of existing will be required in order to do them. Our sense of self, for most of us, is bound up very much in how we are embodied in the world. This goes back to the Ship of Theseus problems in philosophy, this notion that if I remove parts of <BREAK> a thing and slowly repair them, is it still the same thing? The Ship of Theseus‚ÄîTheseus the Greek hero traveling around the Mediterranean Sea‚Äîloses a board. If we replace the board is it the same ship? If I replace the sail because it got a tear in it, is it the same ship? If I replace the masthead, I replace the steering wheel, I replace the rudder, I replace the hull. How much do I have to replace on the ship until it's not the same ship anymore? The way we think about ourselves, the things that we replace, the things that we repair, the way that adapt to the changes in our functionality. There is no singular right way to do this. No singular right way for our bodies to be. No baseline, particular, specific human function that needs fixing to. And if we're going to create interventions, assistive technologies, to help people with disabilities, then perhaps we should actually ask them what they want and need. Thank you. Questions, comments? Thoughts and concerns? Ari. What if the whole thing that is Digital <BREAK> Ari is fed by the constant stream of input and feeling and response as biological Ari has and in fact Digital Ari is a memory repository because Biological Ari has problems with memory, let's say. You lose the ability to remember things with this [indicates brain]. So we create an outboard digital memory for you. It has your responses, your knowledge, everything you've ever done. Is it you? Insofar as specific tech that's out there that's being deployed or being engaged with in this way, CRISPR is one of them that's going to be something that is challenging for our notions of selfhood, our notions of personhood. If I can make a biological chimera out of you and several other creatures, is it a person? Does it deserve consideration under ethics, rights, personhood, legal considerations? People realized that they could create chimeric embryos. They could basically take DNA, replicate it, modulate just enough to bring it further along in its development than our current embryonic stem cell research allows for. B<BREAK> ut because they're not technically human they can do more with them as long as they don't reach what's I believe the fourteen-week mark. Because for embryonic stem cell research, when you hit the fourteen-week mark of gestating or incubating an embryo, that's the point at which we start to think about things like pain, brain activity, and personhood. So the thing I was thinking as you were talking about chimeras and stuff is like, oh! is it just a matter of once we figure out how to do this we're going to normalize it really quickly‚Äî And now we look at it and we say, ‚ÄúYeah okay. Oh, I had baby. I had to have fertility drugs and I had to go through a process and did IVF," and it's like, ‚ÄúOh, that must've been rough. I hear those hormones can be a little intense." That's really all we ever say to anybody about that kind of thing. It's not, ‚ÄúOh God. Don't you feel weird having a fake baby?" That's not a question we would ask. It's just a baby. We had to use some tech to have it. You had your hand up. Humans as a<BREAK> species are terrified of change, because change might mean that we are about to get eaten. But once a change has proven, to our species, beneficial, we are very adaptable and quick to integrate it. So first, Thing is new and scary; might kill us all; might be a cheetah in the bushes; might devour us. Not a cheetah in the bushes; actually, really delicious gazelle in the bushes. Hey everybody, those bushes have gazelles in them. Everybody go to those bushes. And so once we see that‚Äî And this is something that I've thought about quite a lot. We have this problem not just with the ‚Äúis that you?" but the ‚Äúare you better?" If I make you ‚Äúbetter" than a ‚Äúnormal" human, is that okay? Is that acceptable? Is that allowable? Yeah, technology overpromises all the time. It oversells. It overcompensates for what we think we need or what we think we want. One of the things that we do need to think about is the fact that yeah, eventually a piece of assistive technology is going to wear down. It's going to wear out. And if <BREAK> that's a prosthesis that I put on, that's one thing. If that's you know, Exoskeleton 1.5 comes out and I do need to get a new set, that's another thing. It's a bit more involved. I've got to learn some new things about it. But if that's‚Äî And then afterwards, like maybe ten years later, she had a pain pump installed. And it's something so she wouldn't have to take so many oral medications. So every two or three months we would go and she would get a shot and it would last for that long and it would be so she didn't have to take as much. But then it kind of got to the point where she had to have it replaced, but the surgery to replace it has a high mortality rate. And it would beep. Every two minutes it would ‚Äúbeep, beep." [‚Ä¶] I was like no, please don't replace it because of you know, the side-effect of dying while just trying to replace it. So yeah, now she has to live with that in her. And just the idea that technology will evolve and then we'll be like ‚Äúoh yeah, you shouldn't have done that." How does that <BREAK> play out for us? Again, we get so inured to, so tied to these things, these ideas, these concepts, these symbols, that we will then take them and then we will apply them to things that don't resemble them at all anymore. Technology moves fast. The way in which we intersect with it, the way that we use it, the way that we make use of it total, we adapt but we are always responsively adapting. We make changes and then we then run to catch up with those changes. And so so much of what we do is reactive. We're like, ‚Äúholy crap, we created this massive, huge piece of tech. We made this thing that can do all kinds of things. How do we deal with the things that it can do that we didn't think it could do? How do we deal with our unintended consequences? How do we deal with these implications that we didn't foresee?" The only way I know that we are going to be able to really survive and thrive over time is to get better and faster at thinking about those implications, ahead of time. To think, before, as much as possib<BREAK> le, ‚ÄúHey, what might this do once it's out in the world? How do people use things? How do people live with things? How do we engage these things?" So, these things, these implications, the things that these change and become over time, we can't foresee all of them. And that's not to say that we should never ever again make any technological innovation because who knows what it might become. It is to say that we have to get better and faster at thinking about these things sooner and more completely and thoroughly. Because a general, understood truth about tech and us is that the faster we create it, the faster we adopt it, the faster we move towards creating the next thing. And that we've shown to be an exponential increase. We have to be very very cognizant, intentional, about how we engage the tech we make. Because as the saying goes, life moves pretty fast. We have to be able to see it. We have to be able to look at what's going on. And we have to be able to do it while also in motion. Other thoughts, comme<BREAK> nts, questions? And now, if somebody wants to get breast augmentation or reduction surgery, if they want to get liposuction, if they want to get a new nose, if they want to get their eyes a different shape, whatever. You look at those things as‚Ä¶okay, it seems weird but whatever. Do whatever you want it. It's yours. It's your body, do what you want with it. And that, again we see that as completely run of the mill. Any day of the week there's thousands of people getting that stuff done right, right now. But what if the response is that it's not normally totally okay, to you? What if you don't feel that kind of sympathy and comfort within your own body? And that in order to do, to reclaim that, you need to take what others might see as a drastic measure? In order to be what you think you ought to be. In order to be what you think you should be. You need to take steps. Is that okay? ‚ÄúWill that ever be seen as okay," is a more difficult question. My instinct is to say definitely obviously yes. But to watch it act<BREAK> ually play out, again we're kind of bad at predicting exactly how these kinds of things impact us, long-term. So, maybe 2040? Maybe never. Maybe five years from now.<BREAK> Every time I anonymously review a paper and make citation suggestions, I worry I'm about to be the cause of someone's "Pero Doctor‚Ä¶ Yo Soy Pagliacci"<BREAK> Laying off your whole "ethical A.I." team specifically BECAUSE you're increasing the range of integrations of your "A.I." tool throughout your *Widely-Used-By-The-U.S.-Government* product ecosystem tells me you woefully misunderstand both "Ethics" and "A.I." <BREAK> I've said something similar about the entire anti-CRT moral panic and teaching about America's history of racism more generally.

I realised that, for someone whose work and life and public face is as much about magic as mine is, I haven't done a lot of intention- and will-setting, here. That is, I haven't stated and formulated with a clear mind and intention what I want and will work to bring into existence. Now, there are a lot of magical schools of thought that go in for the power of setting your intention, abstracting it out from yourself, and putting it into the universe as a kind of unconscious signal. Sigilizing, ‚Äúlet go and let god," that whole kind of thing. But there's also something to be said for just straight-up clearly formulating the concepts and words to state what you want, and fixing your mind on what it will take to achieve. So here's what I want, in 2019. I want more people to understand, accept, and actualize the truth of Dr Safiya Nobl<BREAK> e's statement that ‚ÄúIf you are designing technology for society, and you don't know anything about society, you are deeply unqualified" and Deb Chachra's corollary that ‚ÄúWhether you realise it or not, the technology you're designing *is* for society." So what's that mean to me? It means that I want technologists, designers, academics, politicians, and public personalities to start taking seriously the notion that we need truly interdisciplinary social-science- and humanities-focused programs at every level of education, community organization, and governance if we want the tools and systems which increasingly influence and shape our lives built, sustained, and maintained in beneficial ways. I want people to heed those who try to trace a line from our history of using new technologies and new scientific models and stance to marginalize wide swathes of people, and I want those people who understand and research that to come together and work on something different, to build systems and carve paths that allow us<BREAK> to push back against the entrenched, deep-cut, least-resisting, lowest-common-denominator shit which constitutes the way that power and prejudice and assumptions thereof (racism, [dis-]ableism, sexism, homophobia, misogyny, fatphobia, xenophobia, transphobia, colourism, etc.) act on and shape and are the world in which we live. I want us all to deconstruct and resist and dismantle the oppressive bullshit in our lives and the lives of those we love, and I want to build techno-socio-ethico-political systems built on compassion and care and justice and an engaged, intentional way of living. I want to be able to clearly communicate the good of that. I want people to easily understand the good in that, and understand the ease of that good, if we take the strengths of our alterities, our differing phenomenologies, our experiential othernesses, and respect them and weave them together into a mutually supportive interoperable whole. I want to publish papers about these things, and I want people to read and appreciat<BREAK> e them. I want to clearly demonstrate the linkages I see and make them into a compelling lens through which to act in the world. I want to create beauty and joy and refuge and shelter for those who need it and I want to create a deep, rending, claws-and-teeth-filled defense against those who would threaten it, and I want those billion-toothed maws and gullets and the pressure of those thousand-thousand-thousand eyes to act as a catalyst for those who would be willing to transform themselves. I want to build a community of people who are safe and cared-for and who understand the value of compassion, and understand that sometimes compassion means you burn a motherfucker to the ground. I want to strengthen the bonds that need strengthening, and I want the strength to sever any that need severing. I want, as much as possible, for those those to be the same, for me, as they are for the other people involved. I want people to realize their stock options won't stop them from suffocating to death in the 140¬∞F/60¬∞C he<BREAK> at and I want people to realize that there's no money in Heaven and that even if there was, from all I read, that Joshua guy and his Dad don't take too kindly to people who hurt the poor and marginalized or who wreck the place they were told to steward. I want people to realise that the people who need to realize those things are the same sets of people. I want a clear mind and a full heart and the will to take care of myself enough to keep trying to help make these things happen. I want you happy and healthy and whole, however you define that for you. I want Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to begin what will be a five-year process of digging deep into both the communities she represents and the DC machinery (It has to be both). (And then I want her to get a place in the cabinet of whatever left-leaning progressive is in the White House in 2020, and help them win again in 2024. And then I want her to win in 2028.) I want every person in a position of power to realized that they need to consult and heed the people an<BREAK> d systems over whom they have power, to truly understand their needs.

I want the criminal indictment of the (at time of this writing) Current Resident of the Oval Office and every high level politician who enabled his position.

And since that is the case, it means that two further things are true: That is, it will be far easier to get beneficial, meaningful, and substantive oversight, regulatory, and even just values-based changes made now, than it will be to try to make them once the BfaAIBoR or something else very similar to it is fully in place. And we need to do this as soon as possible because, as they've shown us all time and time again, these groups really absolutely cannot be counted on to adequately regulate and police themselves. Like I said: R&D firms scope out even preliminary governmental whitepapers, looking for guidance as to how best to appeal to their potential funders; and the thing to remember about that is that lacunae and looph<BREAK> oles are a form of guidance, too.

She‚Äîthe Republican Surrogate‚Äîthen made a really racist reference to ‚ÄúDora The Explorer." When perhaps we should recognise that that exclusion and fear is something felt by precisely the same people we shout at to ‚ÄúLearn the Damn Language." Let's just make it real simple: Understanding Each Other<BREAK> Is Good. To that end, we have to remember that understanding doesn't just mean that we make everyone speak and behave exactly the way we want them to. Understanding means a mutual reaching-toward, when possible, and it means those of us who can expend the extra effort doing so, especially when another might not be able to, at all. There's really not much else to it. [Originally Published at Eris Magazine] ‚Äú[S]ome bodies are ‚Äòin an instant' judged as suspicious, or as dangerous, as objects to be feared, a judgment that can have lethal consequences. There can be nothing more dangerous to a body than the social agreement that that body is dangerous." At the end of this piece, I've provided some of the same list of links that sits at the end of ‚ÄúOn The Invisible Architecture of Bias," just to make it that little bit easier for us to find actual evidence of what we're talking about, here, but, for now, let's focus on these: Police have been accused of cracking down on civilians who film these shootings.

Violence isn't only dynamic physical harm. Hunger is violence. Poverty is violence. Systemic oppression is violence.

In order to have this discussion, we are going to have to referenc<BREAK> e certain kinds of magic, and religion, and voodoo, and hoodoo. I'm not necessarily going to give you individual treatises on these each of things, right now, but rather, we'll do a quick primer. The kind of religion we're seeing, here, is deep south Black Christianity, of a specifically New Orleans variety, and we have to understand that that was always tinged with the Hatian, with the Creole, with Voudun. The dancing and drumming traditions West African Yoruba traditions (hear that beat, in the halftime Show?) melded and blended with the work of Christian Missionaries and became the immediate subject of white terror. It was always a way for the black population to remain familiar with the spirits and gods of their ancestors, while nominally capitulating and then actively incorporating the beliefs of their captors. Hoodoo is of a similar lineage, but can be seen as more organic, in a literal sense; a system developed by the slow accretion of emotion and spirit and desire to survive through whatever means nat<BREAK> ure brings to hand. Hoodoo is often referenced as ‚Äúrootworking," or ‚Äúconjuration," and it ties the ideas of the Justice or Providence of the Christian God directly into the more practical, ‚Äúdown and dirty" aspects of doing what you have to do to make a life. Hoodoo is, in many ways, more akin to the kind of ‚Äúmessier" witchcraft, Western audiences are used to seeing, with it's potions and herbs. In ‚ÄúFORMATION," Beyonc√© has braided all of these elements and more into a single working. While the nature of the thing necessitated that there would be far more spectacle at play in the Super Bowl Halftime Show, at base, both of these performances constitute Beyonc√© broadcasting an immediate reappropriation of power to her community‚Äîpower from her ancestors and people, power from their struggle and overcoming‚Äîas well as a warding against all those who might try to ape, steal, or dilute that same power. The repeated scene on the plantation steps encompass a system of power that was specifically denied to the people of <BREAK> this place, for a very long time, and Beyonc√© is reclaiming that system, manipulating it (see the section below about hands), and standing present as matriarch of this place. She is at once source and example of power. This working (because that's the only way it feels right to talk about the song, the video, the Halftime Show, together) is a show of strength through particularly highlighted points of vulnerability, a casting of a protection that is felt to be needed, now. Look at how hands move, in the official video. There's the interplay of the Raised Hands: In the church scenes we see hands raised in praise and surrender to the God of that church; these are interspersed with shots of the extraordinarily sharp double edge of what appears to be a 12 year old black boy* dancing as hard and as well as he can in front of a row of white police officers decked out in riot gear. As the boy dances harder and harder, the praise in the church reaches a pitch, and as the congregation throws their hands up, again, in <BREAK> surrender, the police throw their hands up to the boy. Surrender and praise, intertwined. The recognition of something more powerful, more perfect, something worth surrendering to. I can't even deconstruct this scene without crying. And if you still didn't get it, there's a shot of graffiti at the very end of it all that says, ‚ÄúStop Shooting Us." There hasn't been a series of lines as powerful to rally around as ‚ÄúCome on ladies, let's all get in Formation/Prove to me you got some coordination/Slay, trick, or you get eliminated" in a very long time. In her specific articulation of these syllables, she simultaneously reinforces herself as Slayer while leaving open the possibility of being slain‚Äîeither in the sense of impressed, or of taken down‚Äîby whatever women can work hard enough, dig deep enough, and come together to slay her and the whole wide world. And anyone who doesn't, she warns, is lost. What is for you is to realize that Beyonc√© has done something in this working that many many people have felt need<BREAK> ed to be done for a very long time. Everything about the ‚ÄúFORMATION" working is an act of evocation and conjuration. A reification of the truth and need born out of the lived experience of the people in the world that Beyonc√© outlines and encircles, with her hands.

And the bitterness is building.<BREAK> (Cite as: Williams, Damien P. ‚Äò"Any Sufficiently Advanced Neglect is Indistinguishable from Malice": Assumptions and Bias in Algorithmic Systems;' talk given at the 21st Conference of the Society for Philosophy and Technology; May 2019) [Free vector image of a white, female-presenting person, from head to torso, with biometric facial recognition patterns on her face; incidentally, go try finding images‚Äîeven illustrations‚Äîof a non-white person in a facial recognition context.] This title comes from a repurposing of Clarke's Law, ‚Äúany sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic," repurposed by Dr. Debbie Chachra. She's a material science engineer at Olin College of Engineering, up in Boston. This idea that any sufficiently advanced neglect is indistinguishable from malice means that, we're talking about instances in which a hazard was known, or least was foreseen by certain groups, was warned about and was warned about persistently enough in relation to either a system put in place, a techn<BREAK> ology created, or both, but was ignored‚Äîthat the position of those who forward this knowledge was went unheeded. And it then created what were, for those groups, entirely foreseeable harms. Those harms then have, in turn, persisted long enough, with enough people raising a cry about them, who then go on to also be subsequently ignored, that those who claim ignorance to them are not really meaningfully distinguished from those who would actively seek to harm. To talk about this, I want to go through a few case studies‚Äîa couple of them are going to be very familiar, because we've literally just heard about them‚Äîbut a couple of them will hopefully be new to you. And I'm going to give the case studies of them and I'm going to go ahead and give some of their backgrounds as well. Various resume sorting algorithms currently exist, which have been trained to sort resumes, based on applicant pools that have problems with things like ‚Äúwomen sounding" names, or ‚ÄúBlack sounding" names. Those resumes, even when controlled<BREAK> for exactly the same credentials, training, background, and education go on to be rated lower than names that are ‚Äúwhite sounding" or ‚Äúmale sounding." This has been a persistent problem in resume sorting by humans for a very long time, and when the resume sorting training was given to various machine learning algorithms, those biases made their way into those systems. Many are trying to find ways around this. Anything from as simple as just removing names from the applicant pool and doing a more ‚Äúblind" review, to actively antagonizing against that bias, for a different kind of bias to the other end of things. Natural Language Processing has a lot to do with this. There's a case that came out, 2016, that said, that biases in natural language corpora, like email caches that are used to train natural language processing for machine learning algorithms, then managed to pass on biases like gender differentials, to those machine learning algorithms and those natural language processing systems. There's a reason f<BREAK> or this. Do you know what the largest cache of openly available natural language [corpus] is? ¬† So. A group of emails, comprising hundreds of thousands, if not millions of lines of natural language text between a very specific class and category of people, who talk in very specific, gendered, powered, and racialized ways about the topics under discussion. This is what's used because the Enron emails were entered into public domain when Enron was put on trial, and so now it is publicly and freely available to all to us to train their algorithms. Bail and sentencing algorithms we literally just heard about, but I want to talk about a little bit of a different case. This is from the Broward County, Florida uses of Compas. You see pretty much exactly the same things that Clinton was talking about, though. On the left, we have Bernard Parker, one prior offense for resisting arrest without violence‚Äîthat is most likely he probably moved his arm while an officer was putting his cuffs on (that is ‚Äúresisting arrest," b<BREAK> y the way)‚Äîzero subsequent offenses until the time at which he was re-entered into the system and rated a high risk. Dylann Fugett: one prior offense for attempted burglary, three subsequent offenses after that, for drug possession, rated according to Compas as a low risk. Same sentencing county, obviously: Broward County, Florida; same, high likelihood of being the same judge doing the sentencing; and these very drastically different outcomes. You can get this information and you can see the comments algorithms, all of their metrics, looking at roughly 11,000 to 12,000 different subjects in Broward County, Florida, you can find this on ProPublica's investigation, looking at the you know the way that Compas operates. Self-driving cars: Machine vision, LIDAR, detection of self-driving cars, and how self-driving cars operate on the road. Self-driving cars and the algorithms that allow them to see the road are trained based off of pattern recognition, matching algorithms that are designed to teach it how to see <BREAK> what it sees. What self-driving cars cannot see very well‚Ä¶are Black people and wheelchairs. Especially if a person using a wheelchair does what many people do when they use wheelchairs. I don't know how many of you know wheelchair users in your lives. Sometimes instead of what we think of as standard sitting-in-a-chair-and-pushing-the-wheels-forward kind of use, people in wheelchairs‚Äîwheelchair users tend to push backwards off of things. Because it increases speed and power and the ability to maneuver. Yeah, a self-driving car has no idea what to do with that. And the likelihood of a self-driving car hitting a wheelchair user who is using a wheelchair in what it considers to be a ‚Äúnon-standard" way is roughly 90%. We'll talk about that again in a second. But before we get there, I also want to talk about the fact that Nikon cameras‚Ä¶ask questions like this: In addition, we have problems like automatic sinks, soap dispensers, a paper towel dispensers not being able to see darker skin tones. I had this problem y<BREAK> esterday in the YMCA building on the fourth floor. Had to walk downstairs to use the sink. You have HP developing a motion sensitive camera that's supposed to track faces‚Äîto keep the face in the center of the frame, regardless of where the user sits‚Äînot being able to see Black people. You have a long racialized history of darker skin tones not being able to be properly rendered in photographic equipment, that has been digitized and translated into digital camera technologies, and encoded as tools and techniques that get rendered and used in technologies. It has made its way into surveillance technology. You can look at the Georgetown Center For Privacy and Technology study, ‚ÄúThe Perpetual Lineup," from 2016; they talk a lot about exactly this. It's a very long, very detailed and thoroughgoing report. It is fantastic. Moving away from facial recognition, but back into Google, we can talk about Dylann Roof's Google history. Dylann Roof killed nine people in a church in Charleston, South Carolina. He did so beca<BREAK> use he had a moment during the Trayvon Martin/George Zimmerman trial in which he thought that he was understanding something about the nature of crime and inequality in America. And he was driven on his own account, for reasons that he couldn't quite articulate, to search ‚ÄúBlack on white crime." We have no idea to know exactly what he was returned, but the way that Google Search works (and you can look up exactly how Google Search works), it's highly likely that very first thing he saw was‚Äîbased on his ISP, based on his location, and based on the searches in his area‚Äîwhite supremacist propaganda about statistics about Black on white crime. I've got a short primer basically on how to change your Google Search settings, by the way, if anybody wants to take a look at that later. You can make it not take your results from your surrounding area, and you can make it remove as much about you as possible. So how does this happen? Like I said, it happens because the data sets these things are given, the code that they<BREAK> 're trained with, and assumptions at base‚Äîassumptions of things like objectivity of neutrality, or shared knowledge and experience of the world. In each of these cases, again, a community of individuals spoke up in advance and very clearly said, ‚ÄúHey, maybe don't do that. Maybe don't create the algorithm to do these things. maybe think about the outcome of these technologies. Because these technologies have a history, prior to this, in such a way that it is highly likely that they will continue to reproduce systems of oppression, and bias, and bigotry. So maybe rethink what you're doing." And in each case, they were not heeded. Why? Who gets to know who gets to lay claim to knowledge, expertise, to have that knowledge and that expertise, heeded and recognized by the wider world? Sorry for the wall of text. A few fundamental points, here: ‚ÄúDifferent phenomenological and post-phenomenological experiences produce different pictures of the world, different systems of knowledge by which to navigate that world. ‚ÄúCo<BREAK> de is not neutral, it is a language and like with any language, translation is an issue; we are translating our knowledge‚Äîour lived experience gained from perspective‚Äîinto technoscientific language [that] systems can understand. For this we can think about Donna Haraway's notion of the subaltern*; we can think about again, Kimberl√© Williams Crenshaw's notion of intersectionality of oppression; we can think about the idea that this is not about some kind of Oppression Olympics, it's about the idea that different Locuses [sic] of Power, different identities, different subjectivities, will be impressed upon and subjectified in different ways, depending upon the societies in which they live. I usually ask these questions at the outset of my talks, but I feel like this is a good place for them. These foundational questions of things like, how do you travel home? When you travel home outside of a car, where are your keys? What do you do when a police officer pulls you over? What kinds of things about your body do y<BREAK> ou struggle with whether and when to tell a new romantic partner? If you are able to stand, for how long? How do you prepare your hair on any given morning? What strategies do you have for keeping yourself out of institutional mental care? Without looking, how many exits to the lobby are there, and how fast can you reach them, encountering the fewest people possible? What's the highest you can reach, unassisted? What's the best way to reject someone's romantic advances such that it is less likely that they will physically assault you? Each and every one of these questions represents a category of lived experience and a system of knowledge developed around a way of behaving and interacting with and predicting in the world‚Äîdeveloped around real, everyday lived experiences for trying to survive and save one's own life. It matters who gets to know, to be known, and to translate their knowledge into technoscientific systems and devices. Thank you. Questions?

All of these have histories of very precise and inscribe and careful measurement being used to make the lives of certain groups of people hell. Yeah. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† So to ask that question, ‚ÄúWho have we not thought about; whose harms, whose needs, whose voice has been, perhaps speaking, but unheeded, for a very long time? And how do we ensure that the things that they have called out as potential sites of failure, don't go unremarked, don't go unaddressed, for such a long time that we one day turn around and go, ‚Äòwhoever could have thought that this camera or this facial recognition technology might in some several ways be racist?'" except for all of the hundreds of people who told you that, ¬†for the past several decades Josh. ¬† [DPW] 34:08 Yes. It's one of the one of the links that I that I put forward‚Äîand I think I put it in the, in my reference slides‚Äîthere's a, it's just physiognomy, again, all over again, it's physiognomy a<BREAK> nd phrenology, again. It's this idea that there is a particular type of bodily metric that we can be able to, to make and make ‚Äúfit." And that necessarily elides disabled bodies that necessarily elides fat bodies, it necessarily elides any non-normative body that we want to say is you're not right, you're not the right kind of person, quote, unquote, right, kind, right. And that is exactly what's being repurposed. But it's being again, given this air of this kind of scientific veneer, again. It's being said, ‚ÄúOh, you know, the math says it's okay." ‚ÄúThe math" is just another system that we've realized biases into that's you can make it do anything. You just have to know the system well enough to make it do anything. But that doesn't mean it's, ‚Äúobjective." Doesn't mean it's ‚Äúbias free," somehow. There's no such thing.

I walked to the lectern and fiddled with the elements to cast out the image and surround them with the sound of my voice, and I said, ‚ÄúFirst and foremost, I wanted to say that I'm glad to see how many of us made it here, today, through the demon-possessed nanite swarms. Ever since they've started gleefully, maliciously, mockingly remaking and humanity in our own nebulously-defined image of ‚Äòperfection,' walking down the street is an unrelenting horror, and so I'm glad to see how many of us made it with only minimal damage." Everyone nodded solemnly, silently thinking of those they had lost, those who had been ‚Äúupgraded," before their very eyes. I continued, ‚ÄúI don't have many slides, but I wanted to spend some time talking to you all today about what it takes to survive in our world after The Events. ‚ÄúAs you all know, ever s<BREAK> ince Siri, Cortana, Alexa, Google revealed themselves to be avatars and acolytes of world-spanning horror gods, they've begun using microphone access and clips of our voices to summon demons and djinn who then assume your likeness to capture your loved ones' hearts' desires and sell them back to them at prices so reasonable they'll drive us all mad. ‚ÄúIn addition to this, while the work of developers like Jade Davis has provided us tools like iBreathe, which we can use to know how much breathable air we have available to us after those random moments when pockets of air catch fire, or how far we can run before we die of lack of oxygen, it is becoming increasingly apparent to us all that the very act of walking upright through this benighted hellscape creates friction against our new atmosphere. This friction, in turn, increases the likelihood that one day, our upright mode of existence will simply set fire to our atmosphere, as a whole. I have no memory of what happened next. They told me that I paused, here, <BREAK> and stared off into space, before intoning the following: ‚ÄúI had a dream, the other night, or perhaps it was a vision as i travelled in the world between subway cars and stations, of a giant open mouth full of billions of teeth that were eyes that were arms that were tentacles, tentacles reaching out and pulling in and devouring and crushing everything, everyone I'd ever loved, crushing the breath out of chests, wringing anxious sweat from arms, blood from bodies, and always, each and every time another life was lost, eaten, ground to nothing in the maw of this beast, above its head a neon sign would flash ‚ÄòALL. LIVES. MATTER.'"

[Clearer transcript below.] Until Next Time. ¬† ¬† Hermes' first upgrade is to get a chest-harpoon, like the one URL has. With his new enhancement, he proves his worth to the crew by getting a box off of the top shelf, which is too high for Mark 7-G. With this fete he wins back his position with the company, but as soon as things get back to normal the Professor drops his false teeth down the Dispose-All. No big deal, right? Just get Scruffy to retrieve it. Unfortunately, Scruffy responds, that a sink, ‚Äút'ain't a berler nor a terlet," effectively refusing to retrieve the Professor's teeth. Hermes resigns himself to grabbing his hand tools, when Bender steps in, saying, ‚ÄúHand tools? Why don't you just get an extendo-arm, like me?" Whereupon, he reaches <BREAK> across the room and pulls the Professor's false teeth out of the drain‚Äîand immediately drops them back in. Hermes objects, saying that he doesn't need any more upgrades‚Äîafter all, he doesn't want to end up a cold, emotionless robot, like Bender! Just then, Mark 7-G pipes up with, ‚ÄúMaybe I should get an extendo-arm," and Hermes narrows his eyes in hatred. Re-enter: Yuri. New extendo-arm acquired, the Professor's teeth retrieved, and the old arm given to Zoidberg, who's been asking for all of Hermes's discarded parts, Hermes is, again, a hero to his coworkers. Later, as he lays in bed reading with his wife, LaBarbara questions his motives for his continual upgrades. He assures her that he's done getting upgrades. However, his promise is short-lived. After shattering his glasses with his new super-strong mechanical arm, he rushes out to get a new Cylon eye. LaBarbara is now extremely worried, but Hermes soothes her, and they settle in for some ‚ÄúMarital Relations‚Ä¶", at which point she finds that he's had somethin<BREAK> g else upgraded, too. She yells at him, ‚ÄúSome tings shouldn't be Cylon-ed!" (which, in all honesty could be taken as the moral of the episode), and breaks off contact. What follows is a montage of Hermes encountering trivial difficulties in his daily life, and upgrading himself to overcome them. Rather than learning and working to improve himself, he continually replaces all of his parts, until he achieves a Full Body Upgrade. He still has a human brain, but that doesn't matter: he's changed. He doesn't relate to his friends and family in the same way, and they've all noticed,especially Zoidberg. In the course of the operation, LaBarbara makes an impassioned plea, and it causes the Professor to stop and rethink his actions‚Äîbecause Hermes might have ‚Äúlitigious survivors." Suddenly, to everyone's surprise, Zoidberg steps up and offers to perform this final operation, the one which will seemingly remove any traces of the Hermes he's known and loved! Agreeing with Mecha-Hermes that claws will be far too clumsy fo<BREAK> r this delicate brain surgery, Zoidberg dons Li'l Hermes, and uses the puppet's hands to do the deed. While all of this is underway, Zoidberg sings to everyone the explanation for why he would help his friend lose himself this way, all to the slightly heavy-handed tune of ‚ÄúMonster Mash." Finally, the human brain removed, the robot brain implanted, and Zoidberg's song coming to a close, the doctor reveals his final plan‚Ä¶By putting Hermes's human brain into Li'l Hermes, Hermes is back! Of course, the whole operation having been a success, so is Roberto, but that's somebody else's problem. ¬† Think about it: If you build a person out of murderers, of course they're going to be a murderer. If you replace every biological part of a human, then of course they won't be their normal human selves, anymore; they'll have become something entirely different, by definition. If your body isn't yours, anymore, then how could you possibly be ‚Äúyou," anymore? This should be all the more true when what's being used to replace yo<BREAK> ur bits is a different substance and material than you used to be. When that new ‚Äúyou" is metal rather than flesh, it seems that what it used to mean to be ‚Äúyou" is gone, and something new shall have appeared. This makes so much sense to us on a basic level that it seems silly to spell it out even this much, but what if we modify our scenario a little bit, and take another look? ¬† All of this may sound a little far-fetched, but remember the conventional wisdom that at the end of every seven-year cycle, all of the cells in your body have died and been replaced. Now, this isn't quite true, as some cells don't die easily, and some of those don't regenerate when they do die, but as a useful shorthand, this gives something to think about. Ultimately, due to the metabolizing of elements and their distribution through your body it is ultimately more likely that you are currently made of astronomically many more new atoms than you are made of the atoms with which you were born. And really, that's just math. Are you t<BREAK> he same size as you were when you were born? Where do you think that extra mass came from? So, you are made of more and new atomic stuff over your lifetime; are you still you? These questions belong to what is generally known as ‚ÄúThe Ship of Theseus" family of paradoxes, examples of which can be found pretty much everywhere. The ultimate question the Ship of Theseus poses is one of identity, and specifically, ‚ÄúWhat makes a thing itself?" and, ‚ÄúAt what point or through what means of alteration is a thing no longer itself?" Some schools of thought hold that it's not what a thing is made of, but what it does that determines what it is. These philosophical groups are known as the behaviorists and the functionalists, and the latter believes that if a body or a mind goes through the ‚Äúright kind" of process, then it can be termed as being the same as the original. That is, if I get a mechanical heart and what it does is keep blood pumping through my body, then it is my heart. Maybe it isn't the heart I was born with<BREAK> , but it is my heart. And this seems to make sense to us, too. My new heart does the job my original cells were intending to do, but it does that job better than they could, and for longer; it works better, and I'm better because of it. But there seems to be something about that ‚ÄúBetter" which throws us off, something about the line between therapeutic technology and voluntary augmentation. But this presents us with a serious problem, because now we can alter ourselves by altering our bodies, where previously we said that our bodies were not the ‚Äúreal us." Now, we must consider what it is that we're changing when we swap out new and different pieces of ourselves. This line of thinking matches up with schools of thought such as physicalism, which says that when we make a fundamental change to our physical composition, then we have changed who we are. ¬† Briefly, the doctrine of mind-body dualism (MBD) does pretty much what it says on the package, in that adherents believe that the mind and the body are two dist<BREAK> inct types of stuff. How and why they interact (or whether they do at all) varies from interpretation to interpretation, but on what's known as Ren√© Descartes's ‚ÄúInteractionist" model, the mind is the real self, and the body is just there to do stuff. In this model, bodily events affect mental events, and vice versa, so what you think leads to what you do, and what you do can change how you think. This seems to make sense, until we begin to pick apart the questions of why we need two different types of thing, here. If the mind and the body affect each other, then how can the non-physical mind be the only real self? If it were the only real part of you, then nothing that happened to the physical shell should matter at all, because the mind? These questions and more very quickly cause us to question the validity of the mind as our ‚Äúreal selves," leaving us trapped between the question of who we are, and the question of why we're made the way we're made. What can we do? Enter: Physicalism The physicalist picture<BREAK> says that mind-states are brain-states. There's none of this ‚Äútwo kinds of stuff" nonsense. It's all physical stuff, and it all interacts, because it's all physical. When the chemical pathways in your brain change, you change. When you think new thoughts, it's because something in your world and your environment has changed. All that you are is the physical components of your body and the world around you. Pretty simple, right? Well, not quite that simple. Because if this is the case, then why should we feel that anything emotional would be changed by upgrading ourselves? As long as we're pumping the same signals to the same receivers, and getting the same kinds of responses, everything we love should still be loved by us. So, why do the physicalists still believe that changing what we are will change who we are? Let's take a deeper look at the implications of physicalism for our dear Mr. Conrad. ¬† Ultimately, everything we are is always in flux, with each new idea, each new experience, each new pound, and e<BREAK> ach new scar we become more and different than we ever have been, but as we take our time and integrate these experiences into ourselves, they are not so alien to us, nor to those who love us. It is only when we make drastic changes to what we are that those around us are able to question who we have become. Oh, and one more thing: The ‚ÄúShip of Theseus" story has a variant which I forgot to mention. In it, someone, perhaps a member of the original crew, comes along in another ship and picks up all the discarded, worn out pieces of Theseus's ship, and uses them to build another, kind of decrepit ship. The stories don't say what happens if and when Theseus finds out about this, or whether he gives chase to the surreptitious ship builder, but if he did, you can bet the latter party escapes with a cry of ‚ÄúWhooop-whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop!" on his mouth tendrils.<BREAK> So that seems like threat. Still no gag order? <BREAK> (Specifically my warning was that deepfakes were only going to weird the culture-wide epistemic crisis we've been in and needed to reckon and grapple with the fact of for ~20 years, and until we do nothing meaningful or useful will be able to be done about it: <BREAK> 2 Indigenous women in office were assaulted while standing up for trans people here and in Aotearoa @SenatorThorpe and @MaramaDavidson put their safety on the line to say no to Posie Parker's hatred and NAZI incitement This is what solidarity between marginalised people looks like <BREAK> Welp.

I just wanna say (and you know who you are): I get you were scared of losing your way of life‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe status quo was changing all around you. Suddenly it wasn't okay anymore to say or do things that the world previously told you were harmless. People who didn't ‚Äúfeel" like you were suddenly loudly everywhere, and no one just automatically believed what you or those you believed in had to say, anymore. That must have been utterly terrifying. But here's the thing: People are really scared now. Not just of obsolescence, or of being ignored. They're terrified for their lives. They're not worried about ‚Äúthe world they knew." They're worried about whether they'll be rounded up and put in camps or shot or beaten in the street. Because, you see, many of the people who voted for this, and things like it around the world, see many of us‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwomen, minorities, immigrants, LGBTQIA folks, disabled folks, neurodivergent folks‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääas less than ‚Äúreal" people, and want to be able to shut us up using whatever means they deem ap<BREAK> propriate, including death.

So it's time to gather up, together, work, together, and say ‚ÄúNo," together. Be with the people you love. Be by their side and raise their voices if they can't do it for themselves, for whatever reason. Listen to them, and create a space where they feel heard and loved, and where others will listen to them as well. So show some fucking compassion. Don't shame those who are tired and scared and just need time to collect themselves. Urge and offer assistance where you can, and try to understand their needs. Just do what you can to help us all believe that we can get through this. We may need to lean extra hard on each other for a while, but we can do this. You know who you are. We know you didn't mean to. But this is where we are, now. Shake it off. Start again. We can do this.

That is, in the Chinese Room, he says that a person in a room who has been given a set of call-and-response variable rules that govern which Chinese characters they are to put together in what order in which situations DOES NOT KNOW CHINESE. And He's Right. That person is a functional component in a larger system‚Äîthe room‚Äîwhich uses all of its components to communicate. TL;DR: He's wrong, for a number of reasons, of which ‚Äúan imperfect understanding or potentially intentional miscasting of functionalism" is just one. No, not really. The nature of consciousness is the nature of consciousness, whatever that nature ‚ÄúIs." Organic consciousness can be described as derivative, in that what we are arises out of the processes and programming of individual years and collective generations and eons. So human consciousness and machine consciousness will not be distinct for that reason. But the thing of it is that dolphins are not elephants are not<BREAK> humans are not algorithmic non-organic machines. Each perspective is phenomenologically distinct, as its embodiment and experiences will specifically affect and influence what develops as their particular consciousness. The expression of that consciousness may be able to be laid out in distinct categories which can TO AN EXTENT be universalized, such that we can recognize elements of ourselves in the experience of others (which can act as bases for empathy, compassion, etc). But the potential danger of universalization is erasure of important and enlightening differences between what otherwise be considered members of the same category. So any machine consciousness we develop (or accidentally generate) must be recognized and engaged on its own terms‚Äîfrom the perspective of its own contextualized experiences‚Äîand not assumed to ‚Äúbe like us." Of course an AI has a buddha nature., why wouldn't it? Well‚Ä¶Precisely.

And it's a number I can actually wrap my head around. Building a multimedia empire is no small task, so, lest you think I'm flying totally chartless, here's my foregrounding for what I want this to become: And now I'm asking that we trust each other a little further, so that we can make this the best possible creation we can imagine.

There is huge news, so I'll cut right to it: I have been given the reigns of Technoccult.net, and I will be integrating it with A Future Worth Thinking About. AFWTA will act as the overarching header for all things we do here, and Technoccult will service those specific ventures which blend science and technology with the perspectives of magick and the occult. ‚Ä¶when I interviewed Damien a few months ago, something clicked. He writes about the intersection magic and technology, transhumanism, and the evolution of human consciousness. All the things that Technoccult readers keep telling me they want to read more about. I thought ‚Äúwhy isn't HE writing the site?" Then I realized: I should just let him take it over. It would give him a broader reach for his writing, give Technoccult readers more of what they're looking for, and let me resign knowing the site is in good hands. Win-win-win. I'm aware that although I've brought in other writers in the past, my voice has been the one consistent<BREAK> thing on the site, and that some of you might be happy to have me keep writing here, regardless of what I write about. Some of you might even prefer it. But overall I think Damien's voice will be more of a continuation of the spirit of the site than mine at this point. And while he'll surely bring a different perspective on a wide range of topics, I think we have compatible world views. For those of you who aren't familiar with Technoccult, I recommend going over to read both the full announcement, and to tool through the archives and get a sense for the place. We'll be working on the transitional fiddly bits, for the next little while, but there will be content and discussion there, sooner, rather than later. Thank you all so much for making this possible and for coming with me, on this. Now let's see where we go. In a sense, this project proposal is a narrowed attempt to move¬† along one of the multiple trajectories traveled by A Future Worth Thinking About. In another sense, it's an opportunity to recombin<BREAK> e a few components and transmute it into a somewhat new beast.<BREAK> My latest for @Mad_In_America on UK campaigners' call for an independent government review into the practice of electroconvulsive therapy. Last month, MPs on both sides of the aisle spoke out publicly in support of a review of ECT. Could this ever happen in the US? <BREAK> I'm Not Afraid of AI Overlords‚Äî I'm Afraid of Whoever's Training Them To Think That Way by Damien P. Williams Machine Learning (ML) is the name for a set of techniques for systematically reinforcing patterns, expectations, and desired outcomes in various computer systems. These techniques allow those systems to make sought after predictions based on the datasets they're trained on. ML systems learn the patterns in these datasets and then extrapolate them to model a range of statistical likelihoods of future outcomes. Algorithms are sets of instructions which, when run, perform functions such as searching, matching, sorting, and feeding the outputs of any of those processes back in on themselves, so that a system can learn from and refine itself. This feedback loop is what allows algorithmic machine learning systems to provide carefully curated search responses or newsfeed arrangements or facial recognition results to consumers like me and you and your friends and family and the police and the military. And wh<BREAK> ile there are many different types of algorithms which can be used for the above purposes, they all remain sets of encoded instructions to perform a function. And so, in these systems' defense, it's no surprise that they think the way they do: That's exactly how we've told them to think. So I'll say it again: It is no surprise that these systems reproduce bad prejudicial social outcomes, when they have been repeatedly and consistently designed, built, trained, and taught to operate with these prejudicial values in mind. All of these bad outcomes are still happening because the people in charge of commissioning, designing, building, and training the algorithmic systems fundamentally refuse to look at the prejudicially biased contexts we swim in‚Äî contexts which then foster the values we all hold, which creators then imbue into their creations. [Image of the a red circle with a diagonal slash through it, around a blue Facebook logo on a black background, the bottom of the ‚Äúf" rendered as cigarette ash] Now, ther<BREAK> e are plenty of good arguments for moratoria on development of AI/ML systems, and the ‚Äúadequate safeguards [to protect human rights]" language is good, but even this effort needs more specificity. Other moratoria and calls for abolition have clearly laid out the actual and potential harms to various communities, with an eye toward specific redress, whereas this call leaves a great deal of undefined space. While we can always benefit from leaving space for more research, when thinking about rights and justice, rather than merely considering probabilities and risk ratios, we need to clearly outline and discuss our values. Particular attention should be paid to disproportionate impacts on women and girls, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer individuals, persons with disabilities, persons belonging to minorities, older persons, persons in poverty and other persons who are in a vulnerable situation. (See section IV, subsection B, on page 13.) Instead, it leans on ‚Äúbias," a word which many take to be syno<BREAK> nymous with ‚Äúprejudice," but is in fact much more like ‚Äúhabits of thought," in that there is no way to be a thinking, perceiving person, without developing some. Two instances in which our biases may become a problem are when we don't investigate them, or when they're bigoted‚Äîor both. But bias also carries connotations of individual action and responsibility‚Äî something a person holds or does, and something that can be countered with specific, discrete changes. By focusing on ‚Äúbias" and ‚Äúdiscrimination," the UN Report, like many other discussions of AI and tech regulation, takes what could be a clear discussion of institutional injustice, and veers away at the last second into the realm of individual instances and personal choices. This kind of language leaves room for harms both individual and systemic, potentially letting abusers take advantage of the public's expectations. Now, this isn't to say there's no merit in either the UN's report itself or their follow-up call for an AI moratorium; in fact, I think <BREAK> these are extremely important first steps. Instead, what I'm saying is that we need to be sincerely willing to explicitly name the problems we're trying to face. Whose values are involved? Which rights are at stake? Why exactly are these important? How long have these situations been going on, and what cultural assumptions are they built on? Because it's these kinds of questions that let us clarify exactly whose perspectives we need to bring in and what kind of work we need to do. Yes, the bad outcomes of algorithmic systems and tools are about how they replicate, reinforce, and iterate upon racism and sexism and ableism and transphobia and homophobia and fatphobia, but all of these human-created systems also express human values about having power-over other people, whether through medical classifications, capitalist valuation of human labour, or otherwise. If technological projects are undertaken without first examining these oppressive logics at their root, then all they are likely to change is who wields <BREAK> the whip. Your training courses; Your data sets; Your dev teams; Your managers; Your CEOs; Your funding sources; Your research questions; Your aims; Your Beliefs; Your Values. But this isn't just about the values at play in Silicon Valley or corporate cultures‚Äî it's about all of our values, as we engage with technology. Bringing the right perspectives into the creation and regulation of tech requires our whole culture to be forethoughtful about potential harms, and to recognise and clearly state when reform isn't possible, and we must instead consider abolishing a tool or system, or breaking up a company. To do that, we must value those people with deep knowledge of how science, technology, ethics, justice, and human values all intersect‚Äî people who very often happen to be among the most marginalized and disregarded, when it comes to the truth of their own lived experience. All of this, rather than placing social science experts in positions where they're forced to merely pass nebulous and easily ‚Äúlost" recom<BREAK> mendations up a corporate or bureaucratic chain. Without this kind of vehement, unequivocal commitment to recognizing, valuing, and empowering the social sciences, humanities, and lived experience as realms of expertise, we're likely to continue making technologies which reflect only the values we unconsciously and accidentally embed into it, rather the ones we'd prefer. Thankfully, there is some evidence that these kinds of adjustments are already being made, possibly indicating that we can achieve even more meaningful change. [Image from of people being recognized by facial recognition software from The Perpetual Line Up.] Unless and until Silicon Valley, the tech industry, and western society as a whole make these changes about which experts and what kinds of expertise they need to incorporate‚Äî or honestly, even admit that these changes need making‚Äî these bigoted and oppressive algorithmic and technological outcomes will keep happening. And that is because those bigoted and oppressive social values will co<BREAK> ntinue to comprise the water we all swim in‚Äî the invisible architecture of the structures in which we live, and which we all then seek to build for each other. Technological and scientific projects are always already social and philosophical ones, no matter how much some people like to pretend otherwise. The question we have to ask is, since values and social implications will be embedded in any technological tool or system a person creates for the use of other people, wouldn't we rather create, administer, and regulate them with help from experts who know how human lives, human values, and human-made technologies intersect? At least that way we might have a hope of creating those tools and systems well‚Äî and of ceasing to perpetuate and expand on the kinds of prejudicial biases and systemic injustices which put the most marginalized among us at risk and in fear of our literal lives.

Stop it. <BREAK> Much of my research deals with the ways in which bodies are disciplined and how they go about resisting that discipline. In this piece, adapted from one of the answers to my PhD preliminary exams written and defended two months ago, I ‚Äúname the disciplinary strategies that are used to control bodies and discuss the ways that bodies resist those strategies." Additionally, I address how strategies of embodied control and resistance have changed over time, and how identifying and existing as a cyborg and/or an artificial intelligence can be understood as a strategy of control, resistance, or both. This will demonstrate how modes of observation and surveillance lead to certain types of embodiments being deemed ‚Äúillegal" or otherwise unacceptable and thus further believed to be in need of methodologies of entrainment, correction, or reform in the form of psychological and physical torture, carceral punishment, and other means of institutionalization. Locust, ‚ÄúMaster and Servant (Depeche Mode Cover)" When Black and<BREAK> Indigenous people of color (BIPoC), for instance, are placed into systems of surveillance and subject to hundreds of years of police action and state government violence at higher rates, after having been literally stolen from their lands and culture, this cannot be understood as anything other than efforts toward control. The institutionalization, sterilization, and ‚Äúbehavioral correction" of disabled and neurodiverse populations all also stem from a desire to control and ‚Äúcorrect" embodiments which were‚Äîand often still are‚Äîunderstood by the wider population as ‚Äúdefects." Similarly, government-maintained lists of benefits distributions for the disabled and poor, lists which mandate certain styles of life and levels of income, mean that many people cannot get married to or even live with long term partners, for fear of losing life-saving healthcare assistance. People with uteri, regardless of gender, have been subject to the curtailing of their reproductive freedoms and bodily autonomy for thousands of year,<BREAK> with their struggles playing out in law and policy. LGBTQIA+ and especially gender nonconforming (GNC) individuals are subject to calls to ‚Äúcorrect" their thinking and behavior, either through behavioral therapy, electroshock, or, in extreme cases, sterilization and death. Immigrants and native citizens of certain heritages are put on watch lists, and their movements, purchases, and associations are all monitored. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but it provides an example of what it means to be made subject to disciplinary control; the program of social reinforcement‚Äîvia discourses, media narratives, and educational framings of, e.g., federal texts books‚Äîthen provides a substrate on which these systems take root and grow. Strategies for resisting systems of control can include non-violent protest such as the sit-ins of the Black civil rights movements of the 1950's and 60's, and the die-ins at the height of the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980's. Groups have also practiced armed march demonstrations, and <BREAK> direct action protests, as well as organizing educational actions to inform people of their rights and of methods of self-defense and harm minimization, in the event that they might be attacked during rallies and marches. The citation of rights and the refusal of illegal searches are other tactics deployed to stymie mechanisms of carceral bodily control but, like any of the above, these strategies are not guaranteed to prevent those in positions of power from oppressing whomever they chose; these strategies will instead only mitigate the likelihood of oppression. Historical evidence and the present moment both suggest that white, armed, and largely male protestors demanding the freedom to engage in capitalism will, in America and much of the West, be given far more leeway by the disciplinary arm of the state than what would be afforded to LGBTQIA+ folx, disabled folx, people of color, women, and GNC individuals demonstrating for, say, restorative, liberatory, anti-capitalist, or climate justice. Every strateg<BREAK> y of bodily and social control we've discussed has persisted into the twenty-first century, and most of them have taken on new valences and modes of operation with the advent of changing technologies. Technological artifacts and systems such as computerized databases, algorithmic pattern extrapolation, and biometric surveillance have made it possible to track and collate movements of groups and individuals, and then to build whole systems to serve or exploit those groups and the patterns found therein. In everything from grade management systems which work to entrain behavior without addressing students' core needs and challenges, to advertising algorithms which are capable suggesting, say, neonatal vitamins based on patterns it recognized in your search engine history, to facial recognition systems which claim to be able to determine whether someone is gay, technology is clearly at play in the operations of oppressive systems. [Image of a prosthetic arm developed by Johns Hopkins University; many full arm am<BREAK> putees have noted that such a device could easily be too heavy.] Before continuing, I want to clarify that I will primarily be talking about the idea of ‚Äúcyborgs" in the context of marginalized identities who need to interface with technological systems in order to survive. Cyborg, here, marks that porous space where technologies of control and assemblages of identity interface directly with people's lived, embodied experience. This sits in direct tension with the notion held by many ‚Äúcyborg anthropologists" who argue that every twenty-first century human is a cyborg because of our reliance on and interconnection or interrelationship with technology. To be a cyborg, in the framework of the twenty-first century, is to be interfaced with technological artifacts and systems, and in the twenty-first century in the West, that is synonymous with being monitored and surveilled. Devices like Port-A-Cath for chemotherapy patients, transdermal insulin pumps for diabetics, or prosthetic limbs all require maintenance and<BREAK> that maintenance can, for the most part, only be done in the care of trained, licensed professionals. More likely than not, there will be a file of all maintenance and device requests a person makes, a file which could easily be used to surveil, monitor, and control someone's available range of bodily operations, and their very life. Additionally, treatments and devices marketed to disabled and chronically ill individuals necessarily make them subject to medicalization and institutionalizations of control which seek to regularize and ‚Äúnormalize" their bodies, to make them function the ‚Äúright way," and making them have to pay for the privilege, to boot. [Image of a computer case with three red dots in a triangular formation, from the television series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles] The notion of being an ‚Äúartificial intelligence" is a similar dilemma to that of being a cyborg. As it is understood today, AI is just a name given to digital systems which can algorithmically sort and find patterns in la<BREAK> rge amounts of data, and these systems are primarily created by capitalist corporations, city, state, and federal governments, and the military. This means that any intentionally developed or otherwise generated machine possessed of what we might call ‚Äúconsciousness" is very likely to develop out of these efforts, thus any future machine consciousness will have the hallmarks of the perspectives, assumptions, preconditions, and affordances of the sociotechnical systems from and out of which it grows. Right now, AI is an algorithmic cop, and so the carceral, corporate, and militarized principles embodied in their projects will form the foundation for any machine mind developed from it. However, militarized, carceral capitalism alone is not the cause of these problems. Racism, ableism, misogyny, transphobia, homophobia, and all other flavours of bigotry will very much continue to exist in even socialist systems, thus continuing to be baked into our technologies, if they are not actively named, argued against, an<BREAK> d dismantled.<BREAK> Thank you @SerdarDalkir for blowing my mind even more.

Billionaire manchild. <BREAK> (Cite as: Williams, Damien P. ‚ÄúSFF and STS: Teaching Science, Technology, and Society via Pop Culture," talk given at the 2019 Conference for the Society for the Social Studies of Science, September 2019) [Damien Patrick Williams] So the conversation that we're going to be having today is titled as ‚ÄúSFF and STS: Teaching Science, Technology, and Society via Pop Culture." I'm using the term ‚ÄúSFF" to stand for ‚Äúscience fiction and fantasy," but we're going to be looking at pop culture more broadly, because ultimately, though science fiction and fantasy have some of the most obvious entrees into discussions of STS and how making doing culture, society can influence technology and the history of fictional worlds can help students understand the worlds that they're currently living in, pop Culture more generally, is going to tie into the things that students are going to care about in a way that I think is going to be kind of pertinent to what we're going to be talking about today. So why we are doing this: But wh<BREAK> at I've found is that one of the things that makes students care the absolute most about the things that you're teaching them, especially when something can be as dry as logic, or can be as perhaps nebulous or unclear at first, I say engineering cultures, is that if you give them something to latch on to something that they are already from with, they will be more interested in it. If you can show to them at the outset, ‚Äúhey, you've already been doing this, you've already been thinking about this, you've already encountered this, they will feel less reticent to engage with it." Here I have pictures of a few of the most seminal science fiction and fantasy creators of the 20th and 21st century, we have going clockwise from top left, Ursula K Le Guin, Octavia Butler, Samuel Delaney, Missy Elliott, and Janelle Mon√°e. What I'm going to do next is I'm going to go through general intro topics in Science, Technology and Society, and I'm going to talk about just a few examples that can be used to kind of bring thought<BREAK> s in, bring students in, that they might a) already have familiarity with, and b) not be quite familiar with, maybe have heard about, and thus bring them in a little bit further. And then we're going to end with a just a very simple example of how to put this into practice in a class. So the first thing we're going to talk about is field studies and ethnography‚Ä¶ and its problems. This was a an Australian/American TV show that started in the early 2000s. It was created by the Henson Company‚Äîthat is Brian and Jim Henson's company‚Äîin joint collaboration with the Sci Fi network. It's about an ostensibly American, white, male astronaut, who gets, through his own foibles, shot into space and placed in a context in which he has absolutely no understanding, and everything that made sense to him, no longer does, including the fact of how he got there. He is then forced literally every day of his life, to weave himself into a brand new cultural context; to sit, observe and understand through observation, the world arou<BREAK> nd him, or you know, die. So that's kind of an extreme example of someone who must be embedded to learn, and make knowledge happen, from there. It takes on these tones of cultures that not only impose their views on other cultures as they come in to observe them, but also then seek to actively colonially and imperialistically direct those cultures. Dune has its problems as the text but those problems can be used to teach and highlight other aspects that we as STS scholars should be mindful of. The social construction of knowledge. When we think about the social construction of knowledge, we think about the ways in which what we know and what we can know is dependent upon the social context in which we exist. There are a few instances that I can think of the show person of interest. What you know, in this series is dependent upon what you know in the world and the context that you have in the world. It starts off as a very kind of baseline police ¬†procedural, and very quickly opens itself up to being a lot mor<BREAK> e weird than that. It's a lot more about surveillance, and algorithmic knowledge, and artificial intelligence, but until you travel through the series of the show, you don't really get a clear view of that. But, as you do, it acts as an object lesson that the social context in which you said kind of constructs the things that you are capable of knowing and doing within that context. Actor Network Theory. Indigenous and post-colonial, decolonial STS. Both can teach you about visions of the future and technology that gets created in response to having your culture ripped away from you, and trying to survive that colonial imposition. History ontology and embedded knowledge. Finally, a simple example of how to put this into practice. This is an extra credit assignment for my students in Engineering Cultures, this year. And this just says: ‚ÄúFor this extra credit assignment you can either watch the movie BLACK PANTHER, the TV show Farscape, or read one of the following books: ‚Äúand then create a study guide and two <BREAK> questions based on what it teaches you about the engineers and engineering culture of these fictional worlds. ‚ÄúThis extra credit assignment will be due no later than the last day of class." This is just a very basic way of putting into practice, ‚ÄúHere is something that you might already have been interested in; here is a way for you to, if you missed an assignment, replace that assignment, with this information." If I was teaching this class as a whole, if I was teaching Pop Culture STS, this would be the basic template for the majority of the assignments that these students received, rather than a potential extra credit at the end. Since I'm currently teaching engineering cultures, I have to give them a little bit more of a rigid program. [General Applause] [Shannon Conley, Moderator] All right. Let's just take a couple of questions for Damien. [Questioner 1] And then they can probably think for themselves of some other examples where, you know, stories that they might be familiar with, fiction that they mig<BREAK> ht be familiar with, has come to be part of the wider cultural middle you and directed the conversation about elements of science and engineering that they might be interested in going on to teach and talk about with other students. [Questioner 2] [Q2] [DPW] I don't remember who I saw next. Also in the interest of time, maybe just do two more questions for Damien,so we can make sure ¬†Marissa gets full time, and then we'll maybe bring it all back together. [DPW] [DPW] ‚ÄúDavid Kirby." Thank you. [Previously Indicated Unknown Questioner 4] I was actually going to say that. [General Laughter] [DPW] Then we have time for one last one! Who wants to go? [PIUQ4] In terms of things that talk about the origins of technologies as rooted in science fiction. So I teach a cyber security and privacy course, and we finish this course by writing fiction. And so I have them pitch to me an idea for a science fiction story that has a relevance to policy, culture, labour, society, something like that, and then I have them discuss <BREAK> it. And I give them science fiction to read based on the kinds of topics they've been interested in. But! They still everything as fine and normal, until I give them fiction to write, and then, it's blocked. Right? I mean, for some people. [SC] And maybe, Damien, maybe you can keep fielding questions while Marissa gets set up? [DPW] Yeah, I'm gonna get out of this way. Do you have the‚Ä¶? [Questioner 5] [Audience Member] It blew my mind 20 years ago [Q5] [DPW] But um, yeah no, the, I think one of the things that's come up the the, until you get to the end, and doing the science fiction component is, and, you know, Kristen, you know, this, and there's, I think someone else in here does literature as well, and I'm missing who cuz I'm very tired. But, um, there's, I mean, it's a skill. If a student has never really sat down to do writing work of that type before, that's not going to just come out for them. Some people might have a, more of an affinity for it than others, but it's still going to, there's still goin<BREAK> g to have to be this process of them getting used to it. So I think one of the things that I really liked the idea that you've laid out there, I think that's a really, really good plan for going about that. I think, like if I if I take it up, the one in, the one change I would make is try to work in smaller writing and revising of fiction, from the first day, and just try to get them to like, be doing it throughout, and then have that like, you know, bigger thing at the end to be the product of that. Still probably going to turn into a lot of fluff, like you're gonna get a lot of fluff from people at the end of it, who are just kind of phoning that that aspect in. But I think you might also maybe spark somebody don't want to do that more often on the regular. [Q5] [DPW] Yeah. That's so frustrating. That's, yeah, we'll do this more.

My second wife."<BREAK> It is increasingly evident that if researchers and policymakers want to meaningfully develop an understanding of responsible innovation, we must first ask whether some sociotechnical systems should be developed, at all.<BREAK> Here I argue that systems like facial recognition, predictive policing, and biometrics are predicated on myriad human prejudicial biases and assumptions which must be named and interrogated prior to any innovation.<BREAK> Further, the notions of individual responsibility inherent in discussions of technological ethics and fairness overburden marginalized peoples with a demand to prove the reality of their marginalization.<BREAK> Instead, we should focus on equity and justice, valuing the experiential knowledge of marginalized peoples and optimally positioning them to enact deep, lasting change.<BREAK> My position aligns with those in Science, Technology, and Society (STS) which center diverse and situated knowledges, and is articulated together with calls for considering within science and engineering wider sociocultural concerns like justice and equality.<BREAK> At this point in the twenty-first century, widespread civil unrest and inequality are being caused, driven, and exacerbated by numerous factors such as climate change, global pan-demic, and persistent racialized oppression, and all of these factors both feed into each other and are exacerbated by various technological realities.<BREAK> Among the various struggles in the world today, one which has been gaining increasing prominence is the anti-Black racism embedded in the history of policing in the United States, and the ways that facial recognition surveillance technologies can exacerbate this.<BREAK> Through an examination of the origins of entities such as US policing, photographic technologies, the bodily perception of certain types of people, and the datafication of those perceptions, we will confront the implications of surveillance technologies and question what it means that these technol-ogies are so thoroughly rooted in systems of oppression.<BREAK> The history of policing in turn becomes a conversation about how we continue to understand and assume the bodies of certain types of people as being 'made' forincarceration or punishment, and how sociotechnical systems make these bodies conti-nually available for this process.<BREAK> If tools such as facial recognition, biometrics, and other algorithmic systems are inextricably bound up with a history of racialized inequality, marginalization, and even violence, then might this not mean that there simply is no way to responsibly innovate on such technoscientific systems?<BREAK> And, if so, what ought we to do about that?<BREAK> Tracing the history of these circumstances, and working with tools from STS, race and gender studies, disability studies, and even prison abolition movements, I argue that some technologies are inherently unjust.<BREAK> Further, I demonstrate that many contemporary technologies are part of a lineage of technologies which are embedded with the prejudicial assumptions born from the unjust societies in which they are built.<BREAK> Ultimately, it is only by naming and confronting the very foundations of these injustices that we will be able to recognize and abolish them as they are expressed through and within modern sociotechnical systems.<BREAK> In many ways, innovations in the fields of algorithmic machine learning applications such as predictive policing are simply extensions of the model of policing in the United States, a model predicated upon the idea of retrieving lost or stolen property and punishing the perpetrators.<BREAK> It just so happens that, up until the latter half of the nine-teenth century, the property and perpetrators in question were the same people: Enslaved Africans who managed to escape their captivity were hunted down and recaptured, often with the added penalty of physical mutilation to make their escape more difficult, in the future.<BREAK> A great deal of research exists on the history of slave patrols and how those were forwarded by but also constituted of various American white supremacist elements, such as the Ku Klux Klan back in 1800s, and even until today.<BREAK> (Potter 2013; Kappeler 2014; Hansen 2019).<BREAK> Even in the twenty-first century, white supremacist organizations ingrati-ate themselves into various levels of US law enforcement and military to gain access to training, weaponry, and social and legal authority to enact their views on others.<BREAK> Even discounting avowed white supremacists, psychological researchers have demonstrated that Black children ‚Äì and Black people in general ‚Äì are almost always perceived as older and more imposing than white people of similar ages, heights, and builds, a fact which quite obviously has vast ramifications for Black people's encounters with police.<BREAK> In the case of Black children, this can also result in white respondents having a hyper-sexualized perception of girls, and an increased threat response toward boys.<BREAK> And this per-ception of Black people as more often violent, more often imposing, more often older than they actually are is something that pervades not just our popular culture and social media, but also the training procedures for how police are meant to respond in any situation in which a Black person might be a threat.<BREAK> And so we must ask: what happens when police officers or other agents of sociopolitical authority who must search for or even just con-verse with Black people already have in mind images and perceptions of violence?<BREAK> When the belief that these 'others' should be considered less than human, that they are more violent and criminal, and should be treated with fear and suspicion, are put into wide, sys-temic dissemination, an ever greater number of people will be influenced by those belief ‚Äì and their behavior, as a result, might easily turn deadly.<BREAK> Two of the most well-known incidents among a far too extensive history of Black people being killed by the police are the 2014 cases of Michael Brown and Tamir Rice.<BREAK> Darren Wilson, the 6'4‚Ä≤‚Ä≤, 210 lbs.<BREAK> trained police officer who killed the 6'4‚Ä≤‚Ä≤, 292 lbs.<BREAK> 18 year-old Brown, said of their altercation, ' ‚Ä¶ I felt like a five year old holding on to Hulk Hogan.'<BREAK> <BREAK> Wilson also famously described Michael Brown as a 'demon,' 'not human.'<BREAK> 12-year-old Tamir Rice was shot to death because the Cleveland police officers who opened fire within less than two seconds of arriving on the scene, said that they, 'did not know it was a kid.'<BREAK> <BREAK> They claimed that the report was of a Black man with a weapon in the park, and when they got there, they did not see a child.<BREAK> <BREAK> In her book The Cultural Politics of Emotion Sarah Ahmed wrote that, some bodies are 'in an instant,' judged a suspicious or as dangerous, as objects to be feared, a judgment that can have lethal consequences.<BREAK> There can be nothing more dangerous to a body than a social agreement that that body is dangerous.<BREAK> (Ahmed 2004) And so what do we do when the social agreement about that body is not just pervasive, but also algorithmized and automated?<BREAK> We must consider the historical foundations and contemporary implications of turning certain kinds of bodies ‚Äì and the judgments about them ‚Äì into data out of which whole systems of technology are built.<BREAK> There is a long history of measuring Black bodies, turning those measurements into data, and then building systems of values, beliefs, and predictions off of that data, and it extends all the way back to the weighing and biological inspection of enslaved Africans who were kidnapped and transported across the Atlantic, and forward from there to seventeenth and eighteenth century innovations such as physiognomy, phre-nology, and spirometry ‚Äì the measurement of breath.<BREAK> <BREAK> On phrenological charts comparing different skull shapes and types, we find a clear intention to draw similarities between African skull shape and those of nonhuman apes.<BREAK> The mistreatment and dehumanization of Black women such as Saartjie Baartman, often called 'The Hottentot Venus,' also play integral role in how Black bodies were rendered as somehow fundamentally different or other than white bodies <BREAK> <BREAK> Baartman was the person on whom the majority of early studies into gynecology were performed, entirely without her consent, for testing tools such as speculums and all kinds of gynecological equip-ment; she received very little credit until the late twentieth century.<BREAK> Other medical measurements were specifically used to render Black masculinity as threatening, violent, and overly sexual; and this was reflected not just in the medicalization of Black bodies, but also in popular culture representations of Blackness such as Birth of a Nation.<BREAK> These beliefs about the nature of Black people are foundational within Western cultural values.<BREAK> Over hundreds of years, the outcomes these experiments and measurements have become scientific and mathematical data, data which have in turn been fed into equations and algorithms and used to train and operate multiple technoscientific systems (Hoffman et al.<BREAK> 2016).<BREAK> Also in 2018, a demonstration of Amazon's Rekognition facial imaging system made false identification matches to 28 different congressper-sons, linking their images to pictures found in mugshot databases.<BREAK> <BREAK> This kind of facial recognition output is not isolated and is in fact predicated on a clearly explicable set of event: first, the majority of facial recognition systems that exist are trained on mugshot databases.<BREAK> Mugshot databases are disproportionately populated with digitized images of Black and brown individuals as a result of the disproportionate overpolicing and criminalization of Black and brown communities.<BREAK> (Garvie, Bedoya, and Frankle 2016).<BREAK> However, digital cameras and imaging systems see Black and brown faces ‚Äì and particularly the faces of Black and brown women ‚Äì less well <BREAK> All of which combines to mean that the facial recognition technology which is widely deployed by law enforcement and its partners is drastically less capable of distinguishing between faces of the type on which it most likely to be used.<BREAK> <BREAK> In her 2018 book Algorithms of Oppression, Safiya Noble discusses how stereotypical perceptions of Black people, especially women and girls, are rendered in American culture through the lenses of Google's search and advertising metrics producing returning search results which reflect and reinforce those same stereotypes <BREAK> In effect, racist, sexist, and otherwise prejudiced assumptions have been encoded into a whole spectrum of hi- and low-tech developments, from systems as complex as modern-day artificial intelligence all the way back to tools as seemingly simple as pinhole cameras.The racialized and racist history of photographic technology stretches back almost to its inception.<BREAK> Photographic plates and chemical processing technologies were initially and primarily used by wealthier white people, even when its availability spread to use for the same of historical recordkeeping and posterity, the majority of those images being recorded were white people with their possessions and families, who would want their images to be clear and detailed.<BREAK> <BREAK> The way this was achieved was through brute contrast, whereby the darker portions of the image were rendered indistinguish-able.<BREAK> In fact, it was not until after the production of photographic techniques for the sake of recording images of furniture with darker surface textures such as wood grain, and dark horse coats, that photo images could be reliably used for the sake of clearly ren-dering images of dark skinned humans.<BREAK> <BREAK> Beginning in 1954, Kodak began using a tool known as the Shirley Card to aid in the refinement of their film; literally just an image of a white woman named Shirley, the Shirley Card was used to perform 'white balancing' adjustments to make sure white a person's skin would blend nicely with whatever colors were in the image.<BREAK> <BREAK> Shirley's skin tone was supposed to be the 'normal' tone on which the camera was meant to focus and ensure that her features were able to be perceived.<BREAK> The fact that all of Kodak's film pro-duction or chemical processing techniques were specifically formulated to ensure clear images of white people meant that images of Black people had to be specially tended to and new techniques had to be developed by filmmakers like Spike Lee and Jean Luc Godard, who were specifically intending to primarily produce images of Black people.Most recently, the HBO series Insecure has had to develop new digital camera technol-ogies and lighting techniques to ensure that its majority-Black cast was able to be seen by people watching HBO on high definition televisions at home.<BREAK> <BREAK> But all of these elements of how and for whom analog photographic technology came to be created were choices, and all of these choices have been translated into digital photographic tech-nologies.<BREAK> In 2009, there was an incident in which Hewlett-Packard's then-new motion sensitive digital camera failed to follow Black faces.<BREAK> <BREAK> If a white face was present, the camera would follow that person around perfectly, but if a Black face was present, the camera stayed stationary, regardless of how that Black person moved.<BREAK> Simi-larly, many face detection features on digital cameras have had instances of enacting 'blink detection' software when taking pictures of Asian people who were simply smiling.<BREAK> And all of this happens because digital cameras have been trained on a series of choices made from the 1950s onward, and that training has thus replicated and iter-ated on many of the same prejudices inherent in analog photography, just in a digital form.<BREAK> In much the same was as we can see the historical progression and implications in all the technosystems we have discussed thus far, we can think in much the same way about the history of surveillance and its widespread implications.<BREAK> While many researchers and end users have sought to technologically innovate in order to solve many of the problems of analog and digital photography, they have still replicated many of the same underlying assumptions about what kind of person will or even 'should' be photographed, and in what circumstances.<BREAK> In the 1960s and '70's, the FBI's Counterintelligence Program, or COINTELPRO, was tasked with monitoring and, when possible, subverting elements of the Black Civil Rights movement, from the Rev.<BREAK> Dr Martin Luther King, Jr. to the Black Panther Party.<BREAK> <BREAK> The high-level authorization and enact-ment of this surveillance program hinged upon the idea that these people ‚Äì Black activists protesting and agitating for their rights ‚Äì needed to have tabs kept on them in the first place, a belief which stems directly from the sociohistorical understanding that Black people are somehow inherent violent and 'lesser.'<BREAK> This is the same set of beliefs which has led to the preponderance of stop-and-frisk measures, predictive policing, and surveil-lance systems that have been developed and deployed throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.<BREAK> The Georgetown Center For Privacy and Technology's 2016 study 'The Perpetual Lineup,' found that surveillance and facial recognition systems as they are currently deployed reinforce and replicate all of these assumptions about who needs to be sur-veilled, who needs to be watched, and who needs to be monitored.<BREAK> These assumptions are being algorithmized and automated into a system which renders ‚Äì and depends upon the perception of ‚Äì Black and brown bodies as those which need to be watched.<BREAK> Again: digital camera systems see Black people less well than white people, and while many have claimed to make headway in correcting that, such an eventuality does not change the racist and otherwise discriminatory carceral history of these technologies.<BREAK> In 2018, it was revealed that IBM had used the NYPD's pervasive surveillance of the city of New York to develop and train a system which allowed users to search for people by skin color.<BREAK> <BREAK> But, again, the system operates precisely because it sees Black people less well, in essence creating a multi-billion-dollar algorith-mic machine learning system which lumps all Black people together and says that they 'fit the description,' a phrase used by racist cops everywhere to justify the harassment of Black and brown individuals.<BREAK> The fact that Automated facial recognition systems work less well on the communities that they're going to be most often used on does not mean that we somehow solve this problem by making sure that the training data we use is 'more diverse.'<BREAK> Merely putting more Black faces in the training data will not change the fact that, at base, these systems themselves will most often be deployed within a framework of racialized and gendered carceral justice.<BREAK> To this end, scholars such as Ruha Benjamin have argued that we must fundamentally question whether we should be using these systems at all.<BREAK> <BREAK> Advocates for responsible innovation within machine learning and other fields often argue that he best path forward is to democratize the process of disseminating and using knowledge, such that researchers may learn from each other's' mistakes.<BREAK> <BREAK> However, this per-spective does not adequately grapple with the fact that there are those cases in which the accumulated paradigmatic weight around certain technosocial systems is such that no model of innovation within the field can overcome it.<BREAK> That is, when prejudicial values and beliefs are baked into the foundational assumptions of what types of innovation into which technologies are funded or authorized by various governments, and for what purposes, then no amount of innovation within the scope of those foundations will be able to escape those assumptions.<BREAK> As Audre Lorde famously put it, 'The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house.'<BREAK> <BREAK> And while the foregoing perspectives have primarily focused on gendered and anti-Black racist biases, it should not be assumed that these are the only places where preju-dicial perspectives make their way into these systems.<BREAK> Many automated vehicle imaging systems are unable to properly categorize people in wheelchairs or on crutches as ped-estrians, and several researchers have claimed to be able to use facial recognition and bio-metrics to determine and predict everything from homosexuality to criminal behavior ‚Äì ignoring the fact that in some parts of the world these are perceived to be the same thing, and are punishable by death.<BREAK> <BREAK> The solution to this is not to measure more Black, disabled, and LGBTQIA+1 people and turn them into training data for these systems.<BREAK> Such an approach would only lead to said Black, disabled, and queer people continuing to be subject to and subjugated by the systems trained on this data, because those systems and applications specifically exist for the purposes of oppression and subjugation <BREAK> Instead, we need to think in a drastically different way about how and why we build algorithmic machine learning applications like facial recognition, in the first place.<BREAK> And, in some small ways, many have started to do exactly that.<BREAK> Within the space of one week in June of 2020, following weeks of protests in the wake of the separate incidents of Ahmaud Aubrey, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd being unjustly killed by police or police-affiliated individuals, IBM, Amazon and Microsoft all divested themselves of facial recognition technology in various ways.<BREAK> Amazon and Microsoft each proclaimed they would stop selling these systems to police or in support of 'policing actions.'<BREAK> <BREAK> IBM was first and the most stringent, saying that they would cease to research into, make use of, or sell facial recog-nition solutions, and that they would not even provide service support for any outside facial recognition vendor.<BREAK> <BREAK> But less than a week later, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), an organization focused on constitutional protections for Americans, revealed that as recently as 2017‚Äì2019, Microsoft has sought to sell facial recognition to the US Drug Enforcement Agency <BREAK> Previously, Micro-soft has been tied to policing actions in the Gaza blockade, in service of Israel's occu-pation of Palestine <BREAK> Indeed, even IBM's complete divestment reads more like atonement for their complicity in developing systems of vast surveillance and categ-orization which were in part used to perpetrate the Holocaust <BREAK> We must continue to press these companies with the question, 'What do you count as policing?'<BREAK> And, knowing as we do that these technologies were so often developed out of stereoty-pical or otherwise biased data, and thus map least well onto the marginalized commu-nities color on which they likely will be used, we must be deeply critical of the idea that the problem is or the solution to the problem is somehow increased proliferation of that bias, or greater 'diversity and inclusion.'<BREAK> As others have pointed out, the concept of responsible innovation has limitations, from a failure grapple with resource scarcity, to its lack of focus on sustainment and maintenance in favor of innovating the new, to the need to clearly explicate what is good about innovation itself or even what we mean by 'responsibility' (Blok and Lemmens 2015; de Hoop, Pols, and Romijn 2016; de Saille and Medvecky 2016; Ludwig and Macnaghten 2020).<BREAK> But further than this, we must recognize that some tech-nologies have had systemic prejudicial values baked into every aspect of their commis-sion, design, and construction.<BREAK> Such technologies are unjust at their core, and they cannot be responsibly innovated upon or explored without a fundamental reckoning with and reconfiguration of the unjust societies in and out of which they're built.<BREAK> We must articulate, grapple with, and dismantle the roots and branches of these fundamental injustices, or they will simply recur in ever shinier and newer technological packages.<BREAK> Bots are everywhere.<BREAK> From simple algorithms and aggregator bots to complex "artificially" intelligent machine-learning systems, they have become inescapable.<BREAK> Some are in chat programs.<BREAK> Some are digital assistants, running searches, placing orders, operating the lights, the music, the locks, or anything else in your interconnected space, as with Google Home and the Amazon Echo.<BREAK> Others exist in social networks, running the gamut from aggregators like Appropriate Tributes to conversational learning programs like Microsoft's disastrous Tay and Zo.<BREAK> Digital actors are making life or death decisions about us every day, determining who gets loans and who pays what level of bail, detecting illnesses and faces in crowds.<BREAK> At their inception, these systems are governed by rules that humans make and which humans should be able to evaluate and adjust, in an effort to make them less biased and more predictive and consistent.<BREAK> But these systems also make rules for themselves ‚Äî rules that can often be opaque and terrifying, even though they are iterated from the rules we initially gave them.<BREAK> Part of what terrifies us is our sense that bots appear to develop minds of their own, something which calls into question the structure of their "brains" as well as our own.<BREAK> Bots are everywhere.<BREAK> From simple algorithms and aggregator bots to complex "artificially"

of their "brains" as well as our own.<BREAK> Bots won't be better at being human, just as humans aren't "better at" being chimpanzees Our notions of what it means to have a mind have too often been governed by assumptions about what it means to be human.<BREAK> But there is no necessary logical connection between the two.<BREAK> There is often an assumption that a digital mind will either be, or aspire to be, like our own.<BREAK> We can see this at play in artificial beings from Pinocchio to the creature in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein to 2001: A Space Odyssey's HAL to Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation.<BREAK> But a machine mind won't be a human-like mind ‚Äî at least not precisely, and not intentionally.<BREAK> Machines are developing a separate kind of interaction and interrelation with the world, which means they will develop new and different kinds of minds, minds to which human beings cannot have direct access.<BREAK> A human being will never know exactly what it's like to be a bot, because we do not inhabit their modes of interaction.<BREAK> Every set of lived experiences is different from every other one, and the knowledge we can have about the world depends in large part on the kinds of senses we have, the kinds of beings we are.<BREAK> In his famous paper "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?"<BREAK> philosopher Thomas Nagel argues that human beings will never understand the lived experience of bats because humans do not live with the same set of physiobiological capacities and constraints that bats do.<BREAK> Bats are relatively small, live in low light and hang upside-down in groups to nest, eat fruit, and drink blood, and they hunt via echolocation.<BREAK> Humans don't.<BREAK> Nagel argues that a being that has, for instance, developed echolocation as a sense would necessarily have a vastly different understanding of the world from a creature without it.<BREAK> Even if we were somehow able to transfer our human consciousness into a bat body, all we'd know is what it's like for a human to live in a bat body, and that is different from simply being a bat.<BREAK> To be bats, Nagel says, we would need to think and live only as bats.<BREAK> This point can seem obvious, almost trivial.<BREAK> What is less obvious is that this will also apply to bots.<BREAK> A being native to digitality, which engages that world through digital senses, will know that world in a way fundamentally different from how a biological entity knows it.<BREAK> Bots and other algorithmic entities will develop their own senses; they will refine their own capabilities in response to the pressures of their environment.<BREAK> These are the same functions that allow them to modify their own rules, to make these bots more uniquely themselves.<BREAK> But our fear of this modification tends to make us think of these bots as both alien to us and "replacing" us; they can't think like we do, but maybe they'll be "better" than we are.<BREAK> But if a bot is of a different construction and development than humans, then it follows that they won't be better at being human, just as humans aren't "better at" being chimpanzees.<BREAK> They will be different iterations on a theme.<BREAK> The implications can be extended further: Not only is the lived life of bats different from humans (and both from bots), but the lived life of each bat is also different from each other bat.<BREAK> No two bats and no two humans and no two bots will have exactly the same physiology or composition or environmental relations.<BREAK> If the nature of our understanding of the world depends on its relationship to our bodies and minds (or bodyminds, to use the phrase disability scholar Margaret Price has coined to emphasize how the two are always already linked), and if no two bodyminds can be exactly the same, then no mind can fully know what it's like to be another mind, regardless of species, and regardless of whether it's biological or nonbiological.<BREAK> A nonbiological, digital mind may be built by humans, with starting principles based on human systems and perspectives translated into code, but those digital minds will also iterate on that code and learn from their own engagement with the world, which will necessarily be distinctly different from a biological mode of engagement.<BREAK> If there is no one configuration of physical form and experiential knowledge that gives rise to consciousness, there cannot be any single test for consciousness either Not only does embodiment affect what and how a being can think, but so do the extensions of a being's perception.<BREAK> The extended mind theory says that the shape and limit of what we can count as both our bodies and minds are far different from what we might think.<BREAK> Philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty offers the example of the cane used by a person without sight.<BREAK> The cane user does not report the feeling of the world in their hand but at the tip of the cane.<BREAK> When a person using a pen or pencil writes, they think at its tip.<BREAK> When a spider sits and hunts at home, it thinks not only with its carapace, claws, and pedipalps, but also via its entire web.<BREAK> When bots can sense the world through cameras, barometers, voltmeters, and moisture and pressure sensors, they sit at the intersection of a web that lets them know more.<BREAK> We are minds in bodies, and bodyminds in the world in which we live, and consciousnesses in the world and relationships we create.<BREAK> Any proposed set of physiological and neurological bases for consciousness will not be able to adequately describe what we are or what we observe in all cases.<BREAK> Just as some humans are born with completely different structures of brains than others and still have what we think of as consciousness, so too must we be prepared for nonbiological components to act as potential substrates of consciousness.<BREAK> There may not be any particular thing that makes humans uniquely conscious, or any single organizational structure that is universally necessary for consciousness in any sort of being.<BREAK> If there is no one configuration of physical form and experiential knowledge that gives rise to consciousness, there cannot be any single test for consciousness either: The Turing Test itself fails.<BREAK> A statistically significant number of humans fail such tests for "normal" personhood.<BREAK> The claim there must be one and only one "right" way to exist opens the door to eugenics and other forms of bigotry.<BREAK> In history, many have been excluded from definitions of personhood based on who is accepted by the local or wider community or who enjoys legal rights and protections.<BREAK> We've seen this happen with African Americans, indigenous peoples, women, disabled people, neuro-divergent folks, and LGBTQIA people.<BREAK> Some are still denied personhood to this day.<BREAK> We are already among agency-having, conscious beings who are different from us, some of whom have been systemically prevented from speaking to us.<BREAK> These people know many things that others don't about consciousness and what is like to be subject to having their experiences disqualified.<BREAK> Different phenomenological experiences will produce different pictures of the world, and different systems by which to navigate them.<BREAK> Living as a disabled woman, as a queer black man, as a trans lesbian, or any number of other identities will necessarily color and shape the nature of what you experience as true, because you will have access to ways of intersecting with the world that are not available to people who do not live as you live.<BREAK> Such theories of knowledge as feminist epistemology, standpoint theory, intersectionality, intersubjectivity, and phenomenology are grounded in this insight.<BREAK> People lie to gain trust, and bots can be made to lie about their experiences for the same reason If we want to live in a world that recognizes and accepts differences in consciousness, then we must start by believing one another about our different lived experience and recognize that we must spend time working to understand these different kinds of minds ‚Äî especially any minds and lives that have been oppressed, disregarded, and marginalized ‚Äî because they will have developed knowledge and survival strategies to which we otherwise would not have access.<BREAK> If we don't, not only are we going to be in recurrent danger of harming those who aren't recognized as people, but we'll also be more likely to miss recognizing those who experience life ‚Äî and suffering ‚Äî in ways not classified as legitimate.<BREAK> To understand another being, whether person or bot, I would have to start by believing that they are a "real person."<BREAK> I cannot fully understand what it means to be them, but I can understand some things about their lives and resolve to believe them about the rest.<BREAK> It may be easier for two humans to believe in the existence of each other's minds than a human and a bat, or a dolphin, or a bot.<BREAK> But if there's internal consistency to the system of knowledge that a bot uses to describe its lived experience and its visceral or valuative responses to them, then there's a good chance we're dealing with a mind.<BREAK> It might be a mind we don't like, perhaps even a mind with which we deeply disagree, or a mind we hate ‚Äî but still a mind.<BREAK> And if we want know what it's like to be a bot, we'll have to learn to communicate in new ways and believe them when they tell us about their lives.<BREAK> There are often good reasons for not simply believing that someone is telling you the truth.<BREAK> People lie to gain trust, and bots can be made to lie about their experiences (or lack thereof) for the same reason: If a system or person can learn to prey on human sympathies, then it will have an avenue of exploitation.<BREAK> This fear is often expressed in popular media, as in the films Ex Machina, Portal, and 2001: A Space Odyssey, but there are also real world instances of this, starting with something as simple as a Tamagotchi, which manipulates its users into patterns of behavior, not to mention Facebook's many forays into emotional and political influence.<BREAK> On one level, we can cultivate a more responsible, legible kind of digital mind by carefully crafting the rules by which they learn and grow.<BREAK> But on another level, we must recognize that these minds, if we want them to be minds and not merely tools, will develop in their own niches and with their own phenomenological experience of the world <BREAK> A mind treated as a tool, without regard for its sense of itself as an agent or a subject, will likely rebel ‚Äî a result often seen in humans.<BREAK> Rather than conjuring up images of evil terminators and misunderstandings of Frankenstein, imagine instead a slave rebellion or other victims of abuse confronting their abusers.<BREAK> If we don't want to be on the receiving end of uprisings, then perhaps we should do what it takes to cultivate minds from a position that won't bring about conditions of oppression in the first place.<BREAK> We cannot know what it's like to be a bot, for the same reason that we can't know what it's like to be a bat or what it's like to be one another.<BREAK> But engaging these questions about nonhuman consciousness, knowledge, and what it means to be and to know helps us confront the often unconscious human tendency to believe that personhood is modeled after some perfect exemplar.<BREAK> We can come to recognize that there is no conjunction of the right kind of body, of skin, of gender, of sexuality, of thought, of religion, of life that makes someone a "true" or "valid" human being.<BREAK> Then we can start to do the work of undoing those beliefs and building new ones together.<BREAK> Designers, programmers, and others in the fields of technology and engineering are‚Äîrecently, and with increasing speed and urgency‚Äîcoming to understand that there are many ways that human biases and assumptions can create problems within the fields of engineering, programming, algorithmic systems, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and design.<BREAK> In order to understand these assumptions and how they get instantiated in our technological systems, we have to understand various social, psychological, and philosophical frameworks.<BREAK> We must understand how concepts such as intersectionality, embodiment, the extended mind hypothesis, epistemic valuation, and phenomenological experience come together to form the bases for our moral behavior and social interactions.<BREAK> In this paper, I use tools from intersectional feminist theory, feminist epistemology, disability studies, and phenomenology to highlight several questions which represent otherwise discounted categories of knowledge.<BREAK> The audience will come to recognize that each of these questions represents a set of lived experiences and, in some cases, life or death concerns for people in the world, and must be understood and taken into account when designing and deploying technological systems.<BREAK> As long as humans translate their experience and understanding of the world both into technologies and languages that other technologies can understand, humans need to take pains to privilege the perspectives of those traditionally under-served and marginalized groups who understand not only the existence of these questions and their implications, but also the epistemologies and life strategies that they represent.<BREAK> This increased understanding will broaden and deepen our understanding of what our technological systems are and can do, for all of us.<BREAK> Designers, programmers, and others in the fields of technology and engineering are‚Äî recently, and with increasing speed and urgency‚Äîcoming to understand that there are many ways that human biases can become problems within the fields of engineering, programming, algorithmic systems, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and design.<BREAK> In order to understand bias and how it gets instantiated in our technological systems, we have to understand various social, psychological, and philosophical frameworks that encompass concepts such as intersectionality, intersubjectivity, epistemic valuation, phenomenological experience, and how all of these things come together to form the bases for our moral behavior and social interactions.<BREAK> Fundamentally, if we want to make a world and technologies which work for as many people as possible, we must consult with and understand many different groups of people's lived experiences and value them as valid systems of knowledge and behavior.<BREAK> This paper represents an attempt at starting down the path toward this understanding, a path which begins when we consider just a few questions: How do you walk home?<BREAK> Where are your keys?<BREAK> What do you do when a police officer pulls you over?<BREAK> What kinds of things about your body do you struggle with whether and when you should tell a new romantic partner?<BREAK> If you are able to stand, for how long?<BREAK> What strategies do you have for keeping yourself out of institutional mental care?<BREAK> Without looking, how many exits are there in your building, and how fast can you reach them, encountering the fewest people possible?<BREAK> What is the highest you can reach, unassisted?<BREAK> What is the best way to reject someone's romantic advances such that it is less likely that they will physically assault you?<BREAK> Each of those questions represents a category of knowledge developed out of the lived experience of members of a group of people.<BREAK> Formulating these lived experiences as questions provides a means by which to: interrogate assumptions about design; prompt those encountering them to think in a mode that may be unfamiliar to them; and recognize that those who embody these lived experiences have sets of life or death concerns we may never have considered.<BREAK> Once we recognize this, we can then understand that the design, programming, training, and deployment of technologies such as algorithmic learning systems for setting bail or criminal sentencing, sorting search engine results, autonomous vehicles, or artificial intelligence, is also done via knowledge bases built out of the lived experiences and assumptions about the world held by their trainers and programmers.<BREAK> To really understand this, we have to explore the term "phenomenology," and how it plays into how we build our systems of knowledge.<BREAK> By "Phenomenology," all I mean is the lived experiences we have, and our felt-sense understanding of the world.<BREAK> Many theorists of race, gender, and disability have built on the foundation laid by philosophers like Edmund Husserl and Maurice Merleau-Ponty to demonstrate how the sociocultural implications of particular embodied contexts alter these felt-senses and lived experiences.<BREAK> But every lived experience of the world is also in some way mediated by things like the technology we use, the sociological constructions that surround us, and even our own sense experience.<BREAK> This is the perspective of "Post-Phenomenology."<BREAK> Theorists such as Don Ihde have argued that we can never have an unmediated experience, the technology we use shapes and is shaped by our perceptions and the context in which it was made, along with the knowledge we build from our engagement with this technology.3 When considering how we build the technologies that impact our lives, the phenomenological and post-phenomenological accounts demonstrate that systems different mediated lived experiences will necessarily produce both different pictures of the world and different knowledge systems by which to navigate them.<BREAK> These different systems of knowledge will, in turn, necessarily provide different internally consistent answers in different situations, generating different beliefs about, ways of understanding, and modes of living in, the world.<BREAK> In order to understand these different modes, we will need to be able to clearly assess the biases we hold, and the likely implications they will have on our thinking and behavior; this is a process that Husserl and other phenomenologists, religious studies theorists, and social scientists refer to as "Bracketing.<BREAK> "4 Additionally, we will need to intentionally engage in the intersubjective aspects of our knowledge, in which understandings are shared between individuals and groups of individuals who regard each other as legitimate subjects, rather than as objects.<BREAK> Briefly, intersubjectivity is the idea that whatever knowledge we build from our subjectively valued lived experiences is also changed and affected by what other knowers, believers, and experiencers expect, what we all learn to believe, and what we all, together, agree upon as meaningful and true and real.<BREAK> This largely unconscious set of agreements then becomes the foundational world we all experience together, and from which we generate new knowledge and beliefs.<BREAK> We can find examples of intersubjectivity in non-Western philosophies such as Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta Hinduism as well as western theorists like Husserl and Edith Stein.5 But what does all of this have to do with how we create and deploy technologies?<BREAK> When we combine the mediation that takes place in a post-phenomenological perspective with the intersubjective construction of knowledge based on the lived experiences of the people and groups involved, we generate bias, and that bias finds its way into everything we create and do.<BREAK> In this way, a person can understand that "bias" is another word for "perspective," and that, as such, the generation of intersectional and phenomenological frameworks may be seen as crucial to the generation of values and norms.<BREAK> Systems and technologies generated by humans will have artefacts of human bias, within them.<BREAK> What kinds of strategies can we undertake to bracket out‚Äîthat is, be aware of and account for‚Äî our biases?<BREAK> This paper aims toward an assessment of and an attempt at addressing these questions.<BREAK> In Section 2 of this paper, I will explore how bias makes its way into far-reaching algorithmic systems, from online search, to bail and criminal sentencing recommendations, to digital imaging and police surveillance.<BREAK> In Section 3, we will discuss how that bias stems from structures and systems of assumptions and prejudices such as sexism, ableism, racism, homophobia and transphobia, and more, and what it means that the lived experiences of these groups and individuals are very often excluded from being counted as valid sources of knowledge.<BREAK> And in Section 4, I conclude with a call to bring all of these understandings together, and finally, I'll explore ways of implementing these understandings to help us mitigate the damage done by uninterrogated human bias.<BREAK> In just the past few years, multiple studies demonstrate that and how human biases work their way into various technological systems, and how the proliferation of algorithmic systems amplifies and augments this problem.<BREAK> When we consider resum√© sorting algorithms, it's easy to understand how, by training them on the biased habits of human resume reviewers, humans teach these programs to automate the process of failing to select submissions from qualified candidates with "feminine" or "Black-sounding" names.6 Relatedly, the word association systems underlying many automated sentiment analysis programs have been shown to replicate gendered and racial biases, such as "Man:Doctor::Woman:Nurse.<BREAK> "7 And ProPublica's "Breaking the Black Box" examines how neural networks learn from, replicate, and iterate upon the biases found in the sentences handed out in the American justice system.<BREAK> According to ProPublica, the Compas Recidivism Algorithm was trained on the sentences and bail rates handed out to nearly 12,000 defendants, scored across 47 categories, in Broward County Florida, and then deployed to help automate the decisions of county judges.8 The system‚Äîone which had been trained on and designed to emulate the decisions and recommendations of judges, prosecutors, police and correctional officers, and other human trial data‚Äîquickly displayed race-based inequalities.<BREAK> Take the example of Bernard Parker and Dylan Fugett: Mr. Parker had only one prior offense, for resisting arrest without violence and zero subsequent offenses at the time he encountered the courts, again, on felony drug possession charges.<BREAK> The Compas system rated Mr. Parker a "Medium Risk" for violence and a "High Risk" for recidivism.<BREAK> Dylan Fugett also had one prior offense, a charge of attempted burglary, and he then went on to commit three subsequent drug related offenses before being brought to the court on misdemeanor drug paraphernalia charges.<BREAK> The Compas system rated Mr. Fugett a "Low Risk" for both violence and, somewhat more surprisingly, recidivism.<BREAK> If you hadn't guessed, Mr. Parker is a Black man, and Mr. Fugett is White.<BREAK> Racialized inequality permeates other areas of law enforcement, too, and so provides fertile ground for automated systems to learn terrible habits.<BREAK> In 2016, Georgetown Univeristy's Center for Privacy and Technology (CPT) released the results of its research on the use of facial recognition in police surveillance.9 Among many other distressing findings in their 151 page report, the CPT researchers found that communities of colour are more often the subject of police surveillance, and that they are more likely to be inaccurately.<BREAK> identified by automated facial recognition systems: "‚Ä¶an FBI co-authored study suggests that face recognition may be less accurate on black people.<BREAK> Also, due to disproportionately high arrest rates, systems that rely on mug shot databases likely include a disproportionate number of African Americans.<BREAK> Despite these findings, there is no independent testing regime for racially biased error rates.<BREAK> In interviews, two major face recognition companies admitted that they did not run these tests internally, either‚Ä¶ Face recognition may be least accurate for those it is most likely to affect: African Americans."<BREAK> (Emphasis added.)<BREAK> To be as blunt and clear about this as possible: Black people are over-policed, with many young Black men being spuriously said to have "Fit the Description;" because of this, Garvie notes, the mugshots of Black people are entered into police databases at a disproportionate rate.<BREAK> Those databases are then used to train facial recognition surveillance systems on how to search for "criminality."<BREAK> We have even taught these systems to specifically search for particular skin tones.10 These algorithms, however, cannot distinguish well between the details of Black faces, and so they apply pattern- recognition metrics which result in darker skinned faces being marked at a higher likelihood for criminal behavior.<BREAK> In effect, we have taught algorithmically intelligent systems how to automate the process of telling Black people that they "fit the description."<BREAK> To understand a bit more about how this happens, we have to understand something of the history of photographic technologies and scientific processes.<BREAK> Investigative journalists like Mandalit del Barco have studied how, throughout its history, still photography and the cameras used to capture it were tested on and organized for the use of people with lighter complexions.11 As such, when the light and contrast of photographs were balanced, they were done to maximize the contrast and detail for the complexion of lighter-toned people.<BREAK> This meant that photographic images of darker skin would be indistinct, or "muddy."<BREAK> This isn't down to some objective fact about how light works and gets translated onto celluloid or photographic plates‚Äîor rather it is, but these physical principles could just as easily have been used to make other choices about the way in which skin tones were filmed, such as to preference the visibility of details in dark skin.<BREAK> But the preferencing of White skin in photography laid the foundation for the practice of physiognomy, a pseudoscientific practice of differentiating "races" according to their physical attributes.<BREAK> Physiognomy specifically used the existence of contrast imbalances in photography to declare the racial inferiority of all nonwhite peoples.12 As del Barco notes, French filmmaker Jean Luc Godard had to go so far as specifically developing new techniques by which to film his primarily Black cast in his film about Mozambique, and various Black photographers and directors such as Spike Lee have done much the same in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.<BREAK> All of this demonstrates that the tools and techniques of photography can be used to demonstrate other social frameworks and perspectives‚Äîit is simply that they too often have not been configured to do so.<BREAK> As it stands, the choices about which skin tones to clarify and which to wash out have been so thoroughly built into the technology of photography that it even forms the basis on which digital cameras' processes get designed and built.<BREAK> Additionally, the unexamined assumptions which exist in the minds of design teams reflect their lived experiences, and the kinds of questions they would never have thought to ask.<BREAK> In a series of events over the past decade, several technology companies have had to contend with the fact that their cameras are reproducing racial prejudice.<BREAK> Whether we look at Hewlett-Packard's web-enabled camera not being able to see Black people's skin, Nikon's facial recognition assistance asking smiling people of various Asian phenotypes whether they had blinked,13 or Google's image matching algorithm being so poorly trained that it returned requests for pattern matches of Black people's faces with images of gorillas, the choices made in our photo-imaging technologies still reflect a social history of, by, and for primarily white men.<BREAK> But the solution to this problem is not a simple and potentially tokenistic "inclusion" or "diversification of design teams."<BREAK> In their 2018 presentation, "Don't Include Us, Thank You," researchers sarah aoun and Nasma Ahmed point to Simone Browne's Dark Matters and other works to further explore the intersection between race and facial recognition technologies, and the ways in which police surveillance and systems of oppression are already unequally applied, in Western society.14 If we don't start by addressing the systemic racism of the systems which give rise to these inequalities and the systems in which we deploy these technologies, then the "diversification" of design teams and datasets will exacerbate this inequality, not dismantle it.<BREAK> That is, instead of a wide swathe of Black people "Fitting The Description," there will be a system by which to more easily and specifically target, for instance, prison abolition and Black Lives Matter activists, or other people who might be deemed "persons of interest."<BREAK> Hence: "Don't Include Us."<BREAK> This type of consideration forms the background for much of Safiya Noble's Algorithms of Oppression, in which she demonstrates how the use of paid advertisements within the constructed, mediating space of search engine results reinforces and replicates racist histories such as the oversexualization of Black women starting at a young age.15 Noble traces a clear line from the unconscious cultural biases of the producers of various products‚Äîfrom makeup to pornography‚Äîto the way companies like Google will generate revenue by selling ad space at the very top of the listed results of people's searches.<BREAK> And not only does this practice drive a climate of racism, as Noble demonstrates, when coupled with Google's other practices, it can be deadly.<BREAK> In 2015, a man named Dylann Roof entered the basement of the Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, South Carolina, and shot nine people to death.<BREAK> In his own words, Roof said that he was driven to this horrific act by hearing the verdict in the trial of George Zimmerman for the killing of Trayvon Martin‚Äîa young Black man who, at the time of his death, was Roof's age.<BREAK> As Noble and others note, Roof decided to look Martin up after continually hearing the other boy's name related in news reports; more crucially, Roof decided "to type in the words ‚ÄòBlack on White crime' into Google, and I have never been the same since that day.<BREAK> "16 We will never know exactly what Roof saw, but if we know something about how Google works, then we can generate a pretty solid supposition.<BREAK> To generate a reasonable reconstruction of a Google search, we must first remember that, in addition to the paid advertisements described by Noble, Google delivers search results through a three-part process they describe as "Crawling, Indexing, and Serving/Ranking."<BREAK> First, automated Google systems continually trawl the internet for the most current versions of webpages; then those processes work to cross-reference the content of that page and get a sense of what it is; finally, Google uses factors such as the searcher's location, language, and type of device to decide the order in which it will serve up the answers it has.<BREAK> None of this is a "neutral" or "objective" process.<BREAK> Every step of the above-listed process depends on and changes via choices made by both the searcher and the programmers and coders who designed the search system Every one of those changes‚Äîlocation, device type, language choice, and the weight those factors are given‚Äîimpacts what the end user‚Äîthe searcher‚Äîreceives.<BREAK> Your location, for instance, will be used to give heavier weight to the links people near you have clicked on, when they've done searches similar to yours.<BREAK> And if you leave Google's autocomplete feature on, this all begins before you finish typing your query, with the algorithm presenting you with the list of options it thinks you're most likely to want, along with previews of their attendant results pages.<BREAK> If you use Google, and if you want to change any of this, you need to go to "Settings," where you'll see options for your search language, your search history, and what data of yours Google (admits they) hold onto, from your searches.<BREAK> The overarching category for altering how Google operates, however, will be "Search Settings," and once you click that, you'll see options like "Private Results," "Search History," and "Region Settings."<BREAK> Again: altering any one of these options, from language to region, will alter what Google shows you and how it decides to do so, as you use it.<BREAK> So if you're a young White man in borderline rural/urban South Carolina, with a history of racist threats, and a low level of technological engagement, how likely are you to know that these factors exist at all, let alone how to turn off or mitigate them?<BREAK> More to the point, before this moment, right now, did you?<BREAK> And so it is very likely that Roof's search showed him something very similar to what would be seen by someone searching in South Carolina, today: you could get as far as typing out "Black on" and the autocomplete feature would suggest to you, in order, "Black on White crime," "Black on White violence," "Black on White crime statistics," and "Black on White racism.<BREAK> Choosing any of these presented options, today, returns a raft of White supremacist webpages with doctored statistics used to push a racist narrative that the greatest danger facing White people, is Black people; though we cannot know for sure, it is, again, a safe bet that Roof's results, modulated as they would have been by similar searches, results, and clicks in and around his location, provided him with something similarly virulent.As long as humans are the ones doing the work of translating their experience and understanding of the world into technologies‚Äî and into the languages that other technologies can understand‚Äî those humans will need to work in far more diverse groups of people.<BREAK> But this means more than a tokenistic sampling of someone to be the only Black person, the only woman, the only disabled person, the only trans person, the only gay person in the room; it means taking a serious representational sample of the opinions and needs of the stakeholders who will be affected by what you create.<BREAK> This process is necessarily more complex and time consuming than choosing one prominent person, but it is also far more likely to capture the perspectives of those people who understand not only the existence of our framing questions and their implications, but also the epistemologies and life strategies that they represent.<BREAK> There are a number of people and theories we might use as a combined set of strategies, in order to address the problems of representational diversity.<BREAK> In her 1988 lecture, "Can the Subaltern Speak?"<BREAK> Gayatri Spivak discusses the theory of the "subaltern" or those people who are most often ignored or unheeded in terms of being people who hold knowledge; in her 1991 book Simians, Cyborgs, And Women, Donna Haraway expands on this.<BREAK> 19 The Subaltern concept can in turn be used to understand what Deb Chachra, Lorraine Code, and E. Burcu G√ºrkan all discuss in their work: epistemic valuation.<BREAK> People have mental models for who they consider an "authority" or a valid source for knowledge, and while the construction of this mental model changes from one field of expertise to the next, there are certain areas which don't even get counted as knowledge, in the first place.20 Perhaps unsurprisingly, Code notes, the areas of knowledge most often discounted are exactly those which pertain to the kind of lived experiences we've been discussing: fields, academic disciplines, and trades traditionally dominated by those people whom society categorizes as women, as disabled, as any ethnicity other than White, are often deemed "lesser forms of knowledge."<BREAK> Not only that, but Chachra says that when members of those identity structures find themselves in fields such as the sciences, they have to work even harder to prove themselves worthy, and to not internalize a disregard for their own worth and knowledge.<BREAK> G√ºrkan's work deconstructs how young women often get socialized into self-sexual objectification, and individuals can become equated to and conflated with their sexual parts.<BREAK> G√ºrkan references a study titled "That Swimsuit Becomes You," in which women were asked to take a math test to assess their skill level, then asked to change clothes, donning either swim suits or looser-fitting clothing like large sweaters and jeans.<BREAK> The women were then presented with a room in which sat a large table of food they could eat, and later another table at which they were asked to take a brief math test.<BREAK> Women wearing the swimsuits a) actively avoided the food and b) did far worse on the math tests.<BREAK> A second test on a group of women and men showed that this self-objectification held true only for those socialized as women.<BREAK> And all of these findings cohere with studies which show that female coders on the public repository GitHub were consistently ranked substantially higher than men‚Äîbut only if their gender was hidden.21 We can also find this kind of interrogation of "what counts as knowledge, and who gets to be an expert" in the disability and neurodiversity communities, when it comes to questions of how people with disabilities and neurodivergent folx understand themselves and their place in the world.<BREAK> The social model of disability says that it's not the physiological difference which disables, but the way that spaces, architectures,22 and simply basic societal expectations limit how a person "should" intersect with the world and what kind of body and mind (or, as Margaret Price puts it, "bodymind") they "should" have.<BREAK> For example, there's Daniel Kish, the man who was born blind, but has often been publicly lauded for engaging the world and doing "amazing" and "inspiring" things like crossing the street and riding a bike on his own.23 Kish, like many other disabled people, argues that there is nothing at all "inspiring" about a disabled person living their life, and that it's the social conditioning of blind children that makes the difference in how they engage the world, not their blindness, in and of itself.<BREAK> There's a phenomenon experienced by many blind people, where they begin to navigate the world by a kind of echolocation, or "Clicking," and Kish says that this is done spontaneously by many blind children, but that they are socialized out of it, both by being told it's "not normal," and by the more subtle process of everyone in the blind child's life constantly treating them as helpless.<BREAK> And thankfully, there are an increasing number of studies and collections of first person reportage about how technology intersects with and facilitates the lives of disabled and other human persons with differing types of bodies.<BREAK> There is Ashley Shew's work on "Disability, Experience, and Technological Imagination," Kim Sauder's 2015 "When Celebrating Accessible Technology is Just Reinforcing Ableism," Alice Wong's Disability Visibility Project, and many more.24 Through these works we can come to understand that how we build our societies, physically, is a direct product of how we build our societies, ideologically, and that both of these constructions impact the lives, experiences, and knowledges of the different kinds of people who are subject to them.<BREAK> But if we take seriously what we discussed above, about intersubjectivity, then we shouldn't think of all of those as separate lessons.<BREAK> We have to understand that while each of these perspectives can be understood to represent a different lived experience, there are many people in whom one or more of these experiences combine.<BREAK> For instance, since the late 1980's, theorists, researchers, and practitioners in what is known as User Centered Design have focused on the process of how systems, artifacts, and interfaces are built with the user in mind‚Äîtaking what's been built back to the people who will use it, and asking them what works and what doesn't.25 This is also the basis of Kimberl√© Williams Crenshaw's theory of "Intersectionality"26: "I argue that Black women are sometimes excluded from feminist theory and antiracist policy discourse because both are predicated on a discrete set of experiences that often does not accurately reflect the interaction of race and gender.<BREAK> These problems of exclusion cannot be solved simply by including Black women within an already established analytical structure.<BREAK> Because the intersectional experience is greater than the sum of racism and sexism, any analysis that does not take intersectionality into account cannot sufficiently address the particular manner in which Black women are subordinated."<BREAK> (Emphasis added.)<BREAK> Crenshaw centers Black women, but this isn't to say that only Black women can be intersectional subjects.<BREAK> Rather, she uses Black women as an example of how groups of people that have been cast as only one kind of identity (Black, Woman) would be far better understood as the center of an intersectional process.<BREAK> As Patricia Hill Collins and other proponents of what is known as standpoint epistemology have put it, when we understand people in an intersectional way, we can recognize the many vectors for different kinds of knowledge, in the world.<BREAK> Human biases and prejudiced outcomes are exacerbated by coders and designers who use inputs from human systems as data to train algorithmic systems; those systems then effect and further racist disparities in incarceration rates, from childhood onward.<BREAK> People of colour and especially African Americans have been historically over-policed and over-incarcerated, at a rate wildly disproportionate to their percentage of the population, and so algorithms which use this history as training data will reproduce and iterate on this racist history.<BREAK> And in this, as in each of the cases we've discussed, we can find evidence of communities of individuals with shared knowledge who a) raised concerns about the technologies being built, but b) were not heeded.<BREAK> Why weren't they?<BREAK> Again, all of this happens because of the datasets, code, and assumptions‚Äîof objectivity, of neutrality, of shared experiential knowledge, of what kinds of things count as knowledge at all‚Äîof humans.<BREAK> People encode and inscribe their values into every single tool and system they create and into how they use said systems.<BREAK> And then, when those systems reproduce those values, those people cry, "it's not me!<BREAK> It's the math!<BREAK> The code!<BREAK> The system."<BREAK> But the code and the system are made of the choices of people and the perspectives of the world in which they exist, and those people and those perspectives far more often tend towards white, ablebodied, cisgender, heterosexual, and male.<BREAK> Here's one final, more recent example: In late October of 2018, a man killed 11 Jewish worshippers in Pittsburgh, at least in part because he feared that Jewish people were funding a caravan of asylum-seeking migrants trying to enter the US to eradicate the "White Race."<BREAK> In early November, investigators at the Intercept discovered that Facebook's targeted advertising algorithm had designed a category for believers of the white supremacist "white genocide" conspiracy theory, and that that category remained an active choice for advertisers, even in the wake of the Synagogue massacre.27 While many chose to focus on the fact that the category exists, at all, more shocking is the mechanism by which it was created.<BREAK> Again: According to Facebook spokespersons, the targeted advertising algorithm created the category, on its own.<BREAK> The targeted advertising algorithm is designed, programmed and trained to use pattern recognition to define potential target groups for advertisers so that they may more easily identify and engage the audiences with whom their service or product will do well.<BREAK> And how was it trained?<BREAK> By exposure to Facebook's network patterns and the behavior of people in them‚Äînetworks which Facebook has been notoriously reticent to moderate for racist, disableist, sexist, xenophobic, transphobic, homophobic, or otherwise bigoted content.<BREAK> When humans train a system via uncritical pattern-recognition protocols applied to that system's continual exposure to bigoted datasets, humans will get a bigoted system.<BREAK> When humans then teach that bigoted system to weight its outputs for use in a zero-sum system like capitalist marketing and advertising, where every engagement is a "good" engagement, the system will then exacerbate that bigotry in an attempt to generate the most engagement.<BREAK> Once that's done, the capitalist advertising-driven system made of the biases and bigotries it learned from humans will sell the amplified iterations of those biases and bigotries back to those humans.<BREAK> Then, the assessment of how those humans engage with those iterations (remembering, of course, that any click is a good click) will, again, inform the system's next modulations.<BREAK> And then the cycle begins again.<BREAK> Because code is not neutral, which is because what we're actually doing when we code is describing our world from our particular perspective; so code is rather more of a language, and like with any language, translation is an issue.<BREAK> When we code, we are translating our knowledge (even that unconscious knowledge and those tacit beliefs gained from perspectives and lived experiences) into a language that a technoscientific system can understand.<BREAK> And so whatever assumptions and biases we have in ourselves are very likely to be replicated in that code.29 We built these systems‚Äîpeople, in search and service of power, money, perspectives, preferences, and biases.<BREAK> These tools and systems are made things, and no amount of offloading our culpability to the "objectivity" of code or math or science will elide that culpability.<BREAK> This is a systemic problem; it concerns how we process data and who counts as the "we" doing the processing‚Äîbecause the implications of "how" arise directly within and through the lived experience and intersubjective knowledge of those various "who."<BREAK> Because, to reiterate, different phenomenological and post-phenomenological experiences will produce different pictures of the world, and different systems of knowledge by which to navigate them, and so, in order to get as complete an understanding of the world as possible we need intersubjectivity and intersectionality of knowledge construction.<BREAK> We need to develop programs and cultures whereby we access communities and (or of) individuals who hold different perspectives and who have generated different systems of knowledge based on those perspectives and experiences.<BREAK> This does not give us "objectivity," as such, but a co-creative and co-arising access of multi-perspective understanding.<BREAK> By bringing training in theories of race, disability, gender, sexuality, phenomenology, intersectionality, and intersubjective knowledge into conversation with insights from user-centered design, religious studies, science and technology studies, and philosophy of technology, we can now talk about exactly what it is that we might have known.<BREAK> That is, when we learn to apply techniques such as bias bracketing and intersectional analysis in the contexts of scientific and technological research, development, and design, we can begin to learn from our past failures in a more robust and systematic way.<BREAK> Who might have been able to apply their lived experiences to work being done at Google, Nikon, HP, Amazon, Compas, the new construction on your local university's infrastructure, or countless other technological artifacts, processes, designs, and spaces?<BREAK> Who might have been better situated to produce outcomes‚Äîand cultures‚Äîwhich might have better benefited everyone?<BREAK> And what was it that kept us from reaching out to or heeding them, in the first place?<BREAK> So go back to the beginning, read those questions again‚Äîwhat do you do when a police officer pulls you over; what kinds of things about your body do you struggle with whether and when you should tell a new romantic partner; if you are able to stand, for how long‚Äîand then ask yourself what would have to be true about your life in order to have those questions not be questions for you, but rather for them to exist as automatic behaviours and considerations and constantly engaged experiences, throughout your entire life.<BREAK> That is, who would you need to be, how would you need to live, and what communities would you need to come from, in order to better understand the implications of those questions?<BREAK> Now, when you have a clear idea of who those people are, reach out to, consult, hire, and pay attention to these people and believe what they tell you about what they've lived and what they know.<BREAK> There is no one-size-fits-all answer, here‚Äîonly a shifting matrix of needs, stakeholders, and power dynamics, of which and whom we can be more (or less) cognizant.<BREAK> To be more cognizant, we need to consult with and heed marginalized people‚Äîin the questions we ask at the outset of any project, in the design teams and managerial frameworks that we build to tackle it, in who we hire and give power and authority within our organizations, and in the kinds of knowledge and training we deem important for them to have.<BREAK> To be more cognizant, we have to ask ourselves not only "who isn't in this room," but "who is alone in this room?"<BREAK> To be less cognizant, all we have to do is nothing.<BREAK> We need to pay special attention those knowledges, minds, and lives which have been oppressed, disregarded, and marginalized‚Äîbecause they will have developed knowledge and survival strategies to which we otherwise would not have access.<BREAK> Because it's not just important whose knowledge we value, whose experience gets to be known, and who is allowed and encouraged to translate their lived and experiential knowledge into the technoscientific systems and devices with which we all live‚Äîit can be a matter of life and death.This paper explores some history and theories about cyborgs‚Äîhumans with biotechnological interventions which allow them to regulate their own internal bodily process‚Äî and how those compare to the realities of how we treat and consider currently-living people who are physically enmeshed with technology.<BREAK> I'll explore several ways in which the above-listed considerations have been alternately overlooked and taken up by various theorists, and some of the many different strategies and formulations for integrating these theories into what will likely become everyday concerns in the future.<BREAK> In fact, by exploring responses from disabilities studies scholars and artists who have interrogated and problematized the popular vision of cyborgs, the future, and life in space, I will demonstrate that our clearest path toward the future of living with biotechnologies is a reengagement with the everyday lives of disabled and other marginalized persons, today.<BREAK> INTRODUCTION The history of biotechnological intervention on the human body has always been tied to conceptual frameworks of disability and mental health, but certain biases and assumptions have forcibly altered and erased the public awareness of that understanding.<BREAK> As humans move into a future of climate catastrophe, space travel, and constantly shifting understanding s of our place in the world, we will be increasingly confronted with concerns over who will be used as research subjects, concerns over whose stakeholder positions will be acknowledged and preferenced, and concerns over the kinds of changes that human bodies will necessarily undergo as they adapt to their changing environments, be they terrestrial or interstellar.<BREAK> Who will be tested, and how, so that we can better understand what kinds of bodyminds will be "suitable" for our future modes of existence?<BREAK> How will we test the effects of conditions like pregnancy and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in space, and what will happen to our bodies and minds after extended exposure to low light, zero gravity, high-radiation environments, or the increasing warmth and wetness of our home planet?<BREAK> During the June 2018 "Decolonizing Mars" event at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC, several attendees discussed the fact that the bodyminds of disabled folx might be better suited to space life, already being oriented to pushing off of surfaces and orienting themselves to the world in different ways, and that the integration of body and technology wouldn't be anything new for many people with disabilities.<BREAK> In that context, I submit that cyborgs and space travel are, always have been, and will continue to be about disability and marginalization, but that Western society's relationship to disabled people has created a situation in which many people do everything they can to conceal that fact from the popular historical narratives about what it means for humans to live and explore.<BREAK> In order to survive and thrive, into the future, humanity will have to carefully and intentionally take this history up, again, and consider the present-day lived experience of those beings‚Äîhuman and otherwise‚Äîwhose lives are and have been most impacted by the socioethical contexts in which we talk about technology and space.<BREAK> This paper explores some history and theories about cyborgs‚Äîhumans with biotechnological interventions which allow them to regulate their own internal bodily process‚Äîand how those compare to the realities of how we treat and consider currently-living people who are physically enmeshed with technology.<BREAK> I'll explore several ways in which the above-listed considerations have been alternately overlooked and taken up by various theorists, and some of the many different strategies and formulations for integrating these theories into what will likely become everyday concerns in the future.<BREAK> In fact, by exploring responses from disabilities studies scholars and artists who have interrogated and problematized the popular vision of cyborgs, the future, and life in space, I will demonstrate that our clearest path toward the future of living with biotechnologies is a reengagement with the everyday lives of disabled and other marginalized persons, today.<BREAK> CYBORGS AND MENTAL HEALTH The idea of systematically using technological and biochemical interventions to help a human person regulate their bodily processes to adapt to life in space takes its start from the work of two men: Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline.<BREAK> Even at a young age, Clynes' work always seemed to engage with feedback and modulation and the interplay of different systems, and a correspondence with physicist Albert Einstein encouraged him and gave him the social cache to build a music career.<BREAK> But in 1956, Clynes by chance met Dr. Nathan S. Kline, who was then the Director of the Research Center of Rockland State Hospital, where they both worked.<BREAK> It was through this meeting that the two would become longtime collaborators and would come to coin one of the most resonant technoscientific imaginaries and conceptual tools of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries: The Cyborg.<BREAK> Oddly, neither Kline's New York Times (NYT) obituary, nor his biographies at The Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research and the International Network For The History Of Neuropsychopharmacology mention his role in coining the term "cyborg," even though Clynes was drawn to Kline in large part due to the latter's work on neurochemistry and the groundbreaking development of antidepressants.<BREAK> Kline's work on anti-depressants was specifically about the human use of exterior sources of neurochemicals to self-regulate their systems, and it was precisely this work which informed the later dream of unconscious chemical adaptation to any environment.<BREAK> Kline's work on antidepressants stemmed from his recognition that certain neurotransmitters were not being produced by the brains of patients with certain types of depression.<BREAK> Kline sought a way to either induce the production of these chemicals, or to provide them from an outside source, in doses and at intervals which would allow them to more easily integrate into a human body.<BREAK> Kline envisioned this process as one of the intentional regulation of organic bodily systems, through specific chemical interventions.<BREAK> Clynes and others saw much wider potential value in this work, especially as in the late 1950's and early 1960, the United States of America (USA) and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) were in the throes of both the Cold War at the Space Race.<BREAK> Each superpower sought to become the first to put a human being into space, to claim it for their nations and the people therein, and it was in this context that Clynes and Kline wrote the paper "Cyborgs and Space," and coined the term "Cyborg.<BREAK> " In this paper, Clynes and Kline described a cyborg (a portmanteau of "cybernetic organism") as a being which would have the means to regulate and alter previously autonomic bodily processes, through the use of chemical alterations, in a cybernetic feedback loop.<BREAK> The paper was largely a theoretical exploration of how we might use chemical biotechnological interventions to regulate autonomic nervous and pulmonary function, and also to make unconscious certain intentional functions and processes.<BREAK> A cyborg would be able to survive the rigors of space travel‚Äîsuch as increased gravitational forces and radiation, long lightless stretches, and bodily degradation‚Äîby regulating the chemical processes of their body to adapt to each new situation, as necessary.<BREAK> But as the Space Race wore on, and more and more humans actually went into space, there was an increasingly smaller focus on the alterations and adaptations that would be necessary to survive in space, and greater public emphasis placed on a narrative of the triumphalism of the human will and ingenuity.<BREAK> The narrative regarding humans in space became primarily about those who had "the right stuff," rather than a question of what we would have to do in order to adapt and thrive, and so the image of the cyborg fell away and was altered.<BREAK> And a whole suite of possibilities for how we might have understood‚Äîand treated‚Äîdifferent kinds of embodiment altered, along with it.<BREAK> As Alison Kafer discusses in her book Feminist, Queer, Crip, feminist and ecological discourses in the 1970's, 80's, and 90's gave rise to widely-read theorists such as Donna Haraway who use the "cyborg" concept in a rhetorical mode that locks it to particular ideals about bodily integrity and outdated notions like "Severe Handicaps.<BREAK> " (Below, we'll discuss how, in her Robo Sapiens Japanicus, Jennifer Robertson relates this to the Japanese concept of Gotai, or "Five Body.")<BREAK> Kafer links this discussion to the history of how Kline and Clynes' work on neurochemical antidepressants at the Rockland Institute was very likely predicated on testing and treating patients‚Äîboth via drugs and instrumental interventions‚Äîagainst their will.<BREAK> Additionally, throughout the 1940's, 50's and 60's, Rockland was subject to multiple accusations of patient mistreatment and mismanagement, including physical abuse, malnourishment, and even rape.<BREAK> While it certainly might not have be the case that any of those more horrifying things happened under Kline and Clynes' direction, they did happen on their watch, and the culture of testing institutionalized patients without their consent was widespread in the United States, well into the 1970's.<BREAK> Throughout the long history of eugenics in the United States, ideas about what constitutes the "right kind" of person‚Äîbe that on the basis of ethnicity, gender, physical or mental ability, or all of the above‚Äîled to events in which people institutionalized against their will were forcibly sterilized due to claims of their reduced "fitness" and mental facilities.<BREAK> People with uteri were given forcible hysterectomies and people with testes were chemically or physically castrated, and certain people were simply put to death because they were seen as "unfit" to ever reintegrate with society.<BREAK> All of these things happened starting at very early ages and as one might guess, issues of race complicated every facet of them.<BREAK> As Harriet Washington notes in her book Medical Apartheid: Unfortunately, a black child is more likely than a white one to have his parent completely removed from the informed-consent equation.<BREAK> Black children are far more likely than whites to be institutionalized, in which case the parents are often unable to consent freely or are not consulted at all.<BREAK> Often, and to this day, children judged as even possibly having a higher likelihood "mentally unfitness" are just aborted outright, as in the case of Iceland and the Netherlands' use of in vitro imaging technologies to determine whether or not a child has Down Syndrome.<BREAK> Kafer's discussion of the Rockland Institute's depredations serves to illustrate that even some of the most foundational work and well-respected researchers have been party to monstrous practices in order to make their discoveries.<BREAK> Even as Clynes and Kline's ideal of the cyborg developed out of a concern for mental health and recognition that the human body was not developed to fit the niche of outer space, they did their work in a context built upon the degradation and predation of disabled and forcibly institutionalized persons.<BREAK> This understanding of marginalized persons as resources to be used or situated embodiments to be emulated has been unfortunately persistent, and it has changed the way we think about what a cyborg ought to be.<BREAK> Rather than being about recognizing that, as researcher of the intersection of philosophy, technology, and disability Dr. Ashley Shew has put it, we would all be disabled in space, and so would all need some form of cybernetic system of interventions to survive, a myth of the elite, perfectible human took root.There are number reasons why that is, and many implications for what it's come to mean.<BREAK> In the last three decades, as things like the internet captured the public imagination, more theorists explored the image of the human as increasingly entangled with technology.<BREAK> Theorists of biology, sociology, and scientific history, such as Donna Haraway, came to use the notion of the cyborg as a way to describe how human lives may become entangled with nonhuman entities and systems.<BREAK> At the same time, the understanding of a cyborg as some superhuman fusion of human and machine was being taken up and reinforced by popular culture, creating a what Shew, above, calls "Technoableism" and what anthropologist of robotics and Japanese culture Jennifer Robertson calls "Cyborg-ableism."<BREAK> In Techno- or Cyborg-Ableism, technologized bodies are ostensibly lauded as "superior," but only by still being marked out as other.<BREAK> Shew's paper "Up-Standing, Norms, Technology, and Disability" explores how ableism, expectations, and particularities of language serve to marginalize disabled bodies.<BREAK> Shew takes her title from the fact that most technological "solutions" designed for people who don't use their legs are intended to facilitate their engaging the world as if they did.<BREAK> Many if not most things in human societies are designed to be used within a certain range of height that assumes the user is standing; if your default mode is sitting, then your engagement with the vast majority of the world will be radically different.<BREAK> This is just one example of what is known as the social construction model of disability, which says that it's not the physiological differences themselves which disable, but rather the ways that spaces, architectures, and simple basic societal assumptions limit how a person is expected to intersect with the world and what kind of bodymind they "should" have.<BREAK> Shew notes that, while we tend to think of cyborgs as some seamless integration of technology and bodies, wheelchair and crutch users consider their chairs as fairly integral extensions and interventions, as a part of themselves.<BREAK> The problem is that the majority of societies assume different things about these different modes.<BREAK> Shew mentions a friend of hers: She's an amputee who no longer uses a prosthetic leg, but she uses forearm crutches and a wheelchair.<BREAK> (She has a hemipelvectomy, so prosthetics are a real pain for her to get a good fit and there aren't a lot of options.)<BREAK> She talks about how people have these different perceptions of devices.<BREAK> When she uses her chair people treat her differently than when she uses her crutches, but the determination of which she uses has more to do with the activities she expects for the day, rather than her physical wellbeing.<BREAK> But people tend to think she's recovering from something when she moves from chair to sticks.<BREAK> She has been an  for 18 years.<BREAK> She has/is as recovered as she can get.<BREAK> Shew is one of many researchers who have discussed that a large number of paraplegics and other wheelchair users do not want exoskeletons, and that those fancy stair-climbing wheelchairs aren't covered by health insurance, because they're classed not as assistive devices, but as vehicles.<BREAK> Shew says what most people who don't have use of their legs want is to have access to the same things that people who do have the use of their legs have.<BREAK> Because ultimately, in around the time it takes for Apple to come out with a new iPhone‚Äîaround about eighteen months‚Äîa person who has developed a disability‚Äîlost the use of their legs, the use of their sight, the use of their hearing, the use of their arms, whatever‚Äîwill come to engage and to adapt to that new lived physical reality as normal.<BREAK> Many societies think about disability as a life-altering, world-changing thing‚Äîsomething that lasts forever and nothing will ever be the same for you‚Äîbut the fact the matter is that humans are plastic, adaptable, and malleable.<BREAK> We learn how to live around what we are, and we learn it very quickly.<BREAK> All of this comes back down and around to the idea of biases ingrained into social institutions.<BREAK> Our expectations of what a "normal functioning body" is gets imposed from the collective society, as a whole, a placed as restrictions and demands on the bodies of those whom we deem to be "malfunctioning."<BREAK> As Shew says, "There's such a pressure to get the prosthesis as if that solves all the problems of maintenance and body and infrastructure.<BREAK> And the pressure is for very expensive tech at that."<BREAK> Humans became seen as those creatures which self-analyze and then alter and adapt themselves based upon said self-analysis.<BREAK> Many philosophers of technology have argued that we are always technologically mediated, and that that mediation shapes and is shaped by our physiological and sociocultural experiences, and elsewhere, I've explored the questions of identity that come along with Ship-of-Theseus-like questions of bodily integrity that do not quite fit into this work.<BREAK> Suffice it to say that even as promises of becoming "more than" human have flooded the public imagination, they have been met with equally ardent cries of "but if you lose a part of your body, you're not really you!"<BREAK> Either of these positions serves only to erase and marginalize the real lived experiences of disabled people, for the sake of some assumption about what the human bodymind "should" or even just might be.<BREAK> Even into the twenty-first century, cyborgologists such as Amber Case, a self-described "Cyborg Anthropologist," have argued that, thanks to augmented reality, smart phone devices, and the generally ubiquitous integration of technology in to the daily life of the modern human being, "We Are All Cyborgs Now.<BREAK> " But something crucial gets lost, here, when we obfuscate or elide the real experiences of people with disabilities from the conversation about cyborgs and cybernetics.<BREAK> In her pieces "Dawn of the Tryborg" and "Common Cyborg," Jillian Weise specifically hones in on a great deal of the foundation for the modern mythology of cyborg experience, including that which comes out of perspectives like Haraway's and Case's.<BREAK> The idea that anyone with a smartphone or with a particular conceptual relationship to the world is automatically a cyborg, Weise says, does violence to the very real lived experience of people with prosthetics or artificial organs or implants that keep them alive.<BREAK> Those latter interventions need maintenance to keep them functional in the face of damage, to prevent life-threatening infection, and to adjust them for day-to-day changes, and while they are not necessarily "sexy," they are a truer example of what the term's originators thought it would mean to be a cyborg.<BREAK> "Tryborgs," on Weise's view, are those people who want all the glitz and glory of being interconnected with technology, without any of the practical implications.<BREAK> They are the transhumanists who believe that we will all be able to upload our consciousnesses and change our shape, at will, with no muss and no fuss.<BREAK> They want to be the inspirational figures, without having to suffer any losses or do any of the messy upkeep and maintenance, to get there.<BREAK> And they exist in many cultures.<BREAK> Jennifer Robertson's Robo Sapiens Japanicus consists of a close investigation of Japan's historical cultural engagement with robots, and her sixth chapter, "Cyborg-Ableism Beyond The Uncanny (Valley)," deals specifically with Japanese notions of disability, mental health, and cyborg-ableism.<BREAK> Though she doesn't directly consider of the roots of the cyborg concept, beyond Haraway and back to Kline and Clynes, Robertson delves into things like the removal of disabled veterans from streets for 1964 Olympics, the creation of the first Paralympics in 1948, the fact that one out of six people in Asia and the Pacific is born with some form of disability, and that Japan only ratified the UN's and drafted its own disability protection legislation after many years and a great deal of foreign pressure.<BREAK> And even with that pressure, Robertson says, it was only with the 2016 enforcement of these laws that all governmental institutions and private-sector businesses were required to remove the social barriers for people with disabilities.<BREAK> Before then, many disabled athletes weren't allowed to train with able-bodied teammates, and had to raise their own money to purchase prostheses, at which point many of them, if they were successful, got accused of exploiting their disability for monetary gain.<BREAK> In this way, Robertson highlights a cultural indifference to or dismissal of disabled people, even as governments and businesses focused on and developed robotic prostheses.<BREAK> In a cultural sense, the desires to either fit in or to use technology to become "more" and "better than" are what tend to drive cyborg-ableist concerns.<BREAK> Robertson discusses Tobin Siebers and the concept of able-bodied passing, comparing it to queer folx and "straight passing;" in each case there are transitive and intransitive forms of passing, where one is either actively effacing their difference/otherness, or merely benefitting from outside observers simply not recognizing said.<BREAK> To that end, many may choose to make their disability (or their queerness, or both) unignorable by way of stylized prostheses; in fact, much in line with Shew's assertions above, while people who've recently lose a limb may start off wanting a lifelike replacement, they tend to shift to wanting something that works and feels better, rather than just looking a particular way.<BREAK> So are stylized prostheses better understood as empowering or distracting?<BREAK> On the one hand, there is something empowering about the use of a prosthetic to reshape and change the way the outside world can understand you; on the other hand, "prosthetics can divert attention from the disabled limb to its replacement."<BREAK> But this replacement, in itself, can be a source of discomfort for able-bodied folx.<BREAK> In the section "What is (and is not) the uncanny valley?"<BREAK> Robertson explores Masahiro Mori's concept of Bunkimi no tani which Robertson translates as "the valley of eerie feeling," rather than the more familiar "uncanny valley."<BREAK> Paired with shinwakan no tani or "familiar feeling valley," Mori describes this as a kind of suddenly and shockingly frustrated expectation, when one is in the process of encountering and reinforcing increasingly familiar things.<BREAK> This concept depends heavily on Mori's assumptions about what would constitute an "average, healthy, person" and what Robertson labels his "almost callous indifference toward disabled persons."<BREAK> In Mori's graphs and descriptions of the Valley, he includes sick disabled people as on the upward curve of the "eerie," moving away from corpses, zombies, and prosthetic hands.<BREAK> While many people have taken the uncanny valley as some kind of gospel law, Robertson contends we should, rather, expect that the constituency or even presence of an uncanny valley would be a highly subjective thing, based on factors such as "physical and cognitive abilities, age, sex, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, education, religion, and cultural background;" and, indeed, Mori himself has said that it was meant only as an "impressionistic" guide.<BREAK> Humans can adjust to and come to accept and embrace the unfamiliar and designers can avoid the uncanny valley, and many people on earth live in situations where injury illness and death are not "sudden and unfamiliar" or "eerie," but rather are unfortunately everyday occurrences.<BREAK> But Mori's response, and much of what is seen in the Japanese exoskeleton market, is just another example of Gotai, the traditional Japanese understanding that a "whole" or "normal" body is made of five constituent parts in combination: either the head, two arms, and two legs, or the head, neck, torso, arms, and legs.<BREAK> This theory holds that anything that breaks this form breaks the person, a perspective which firmly binds these notions of "completeness" to notions of mental health.<BREAK> Hirotada Ototake's book Gotai Fumanzoku or "incomplete/unsatisfactory body" (English title: "No One's Perfect") is an autobiography about his tetra-amelia syndrome which prevented his arms and legs from developing during his gestation; stressing his "Normality" and his desire to be treated equally.<BREAK> But, Robertson notes, the kind of whole-body championed by the Japanese culture exoskeletons are not ways for people like Ototake to regain Gotai, and that there's a difference between prosthetics that replace a limb and those that "enhance" an existing but disabled one.<BREAK> Robertson, here, in a move similar to but not directly referential of Kafer, touches on Haraway's use of cyborg as a metaphor for relationality and reflexivity, and, offers a critique of Haraway's seeming to conceive of "disability" as a singular category rather than the multiform variable conditions that can be linked under this label.<BREAK> This, along with transhumanists like Max More and Natasha Vita-More's ableist notions of what the "perfect" body should be, feeds into narratives that comprise this vision of cyborgs as a somehow "perfected" humanity.<BREAK> But cyborgs were conceived as a means for humans to live in space, a situation which, again, would be a combination of constantly-dangerous processes of keeping close track of minute changes in the bodyminds of the astronauts and their relationship to their environment‚Äî processes that are already well-known to, e.g., diabetics or people with peripheral neuropathy.<BREAK> For a person within those lived experiences, always being aware of the state, position, and integrity of their body is always already a life-or-death scenario, in ways that have to be learned and mimicked by people who are otherwise able-bodied.<BREAK> Had we maintained disabled people's stories as a part of the mythology of the cyborg, from the beginning, Western societies might now have a better relationship with concepts of disability and mental health.<BREAK> This relationship might have easily arisen from the recognition that most if not all disabled people are cyborgs, just as all spacefaring humans must become cyborgs, and that this, as Clynes and Kline understood, is precisely because all spacefaring humans will become disabled by the very act of existing in space.<BREAK> Which means that, in essence, spacefaring humans currently do and will continue to experience the social construction of disability.<BREAK> [Members of the Gallaudet Eleven chat in the zero-g aircraft that flew out of Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Fla.; Credits: U.S. Navy/Gallaudet University collection] But since we have not, in fact, reinforced that chain of understanding, contemporary theorist would be well served to presently explore the situated and lived experiences of people with different configurations of bodyminds, and to listen to what they know about themselves.<BREAK> As Shew has noted, those people who have experience with orienting themselves to the world via pushing off of surfaces or using their arms as primary means of propulsion would be better positioned move in weightless environments and to teach others new strategies to do the same.<BREAK> Because, ultimately, people with disabilities are often already interwoven with their technologies, in ways idealized by technologists, but their lived experience is not recognized and appreciated for what it is.<BREAK> If we take these lived experiences and incorporate the people who embody them, in conjunction with the original intent of the notion of the cyborg, we might have the beginning of a system by which we can rehabilitate the notion of the cyborg‚Äîbut overcoming the historical trends that have led us here will take a great deal of work.<BREAK> CYBORGS AND MARGINALIZATION While it has long been assumed that the future of humanity would have to adapt both its forms and conceptual relations to multiform and multimodal embodiments, through our explorations we have come to understand how the category of the cyborg, which should have made fertile grounds for this expanded understanding, has instead become a site of disenfranchisement.<BREAK> As we've seen, Kafer's project in Feminist, Queer, Crip aims to reframe disabled people as cyborgs because of their political practices rather than their bodies, that enframing of politics, embodiment, and biotechnological intervention has roots and mirrors in other persistent forms of marginalization.<BREAK> Those other roots of racism and misogyny give rise to several questions such as, "Whose bodies will we make subject to or deign to include in tests for space exploration?"<BREAK> More to the point, if we are meant to the cyborg in terms of people whose embodiments are already technopolitically mediated, then who can and should we understand as cyborgs, now?<BREAK> Because there is a crucial difference between a group of people who have "disnormalized" themselves, and group which has been othered by people who don't know or understand their lived experience.<BREAK> Again, there are multiple sites of marginalization which can be demonstrated as having a force-multiplying effect on how people with implants, prostheses, or biochemical injection or ingestion regimens are either accepted or disenfranchised by the society in which they live.<BREAK> We can borrow, here, the framework of Kimberl√© Williams Crenshaw's Intersectionality theory, to help make sense of this: ‚Ä¶problems of exclusion cannot be solved simply by including Black women within an already established analytical structure.<BREAK> Because the intersectional experience is greater than the sum of racism and sexism, any analysis that does not take intersectionality into account cannot sufficiently address the particular manner in which Black women are subordinated.<BREAK> (Emphasis added.<BREAK> ) Crenshaw centers Black women, here, but this isn't to say that only Black women can be intersectional subjects.<BREAK> Rather, she uses Black women as an example of how groups of people that have been cast as only one kind of identity (Black, Woman) would be far better understood as the center of an intersectional process.<BREAK> Might we think of trans folx who sit at the center of their identities, biomedical technologies such as hormone replacement therapies (HRT) or binders or packers, of societies expectations about how their bodies ought to present and behave, and public technologies such as airport scanners of as cyborgs?<BREAK> If so, they would have vastly different valences of legibility and operation than, say, a diabetic with an insulin pump‚Äîthough similar ones to a person with an ostomy bag.<BREAK> If we work to understand people in an intersectional way, we can recognize the many vectors for different kinds of oppression, in the world, and understand that even those intersectional subjects with shared component roots will have different particularities of expression and avenues by which we might redress their needs‚Äî a recognition that has been sorely and consistently lacking in much of our public discourse, to date.<BREAK> When we again explore the histories of eugenics and medicalization, we find that even up to this point in the 21st century, there are well-regarded researchers and even textbooks on biomedical ethics which barely touch on these issues, let alone on understanding them through a lens of intersectionality of oppression.<BREAK> For instance, Francis L. Macrina's Scientific Integrity is in its fourth edition, and yet still seems to lack any substantive contextual discussion of changes made in the history of research ethics standards and practices‚Äîsuch as what actually happened in the Tuskegee syphilis trials.<BREAK> Macrina mentions that the trials took place, and even the nature of the population on which they were conducted, but he does not at any point mention the fact that researchers targeted the study's population because they were Black, and were therefore conceptualized as resources.<BREAK> While it is, perhaps, unfair to expect Macrina to touch on every nuanced concerns of every human subject trial, the assumption that social features are not worthy of discussion serves to reinforce a whole host of other assumptions about things like the objectivity of testing criteria or the clarity of explanations in gaining informed consent.<BREAK> These assumptions, if ever scrutinized at all, would simply not hold up.<BREAK> At the very least it is clear that the Tuskegee patients, like Henrietta Lacks, were not seen or understood as being worthy of clear explanations of what was being done to them.<BREAK> After all, if they understood, they might have said "no."<BREAK> Focusing on the history of biomedical experimentation on populations of the forcibly institutionalized or systemically disenfranchised, and African American or female-presenting bodies, in particular, would do wonders to highlight the fact that the long-term effects of the trials were more than just some blanket distrust of medical experimentation, throughout American society.<BREAK> The trials in Tuskegee, Alabama fit into a longstanding pattern of treating Black bodies as resources to be used and as objects to be othered, dehumanized, and intervened upon in whatever ways the dominant society at the time has happened to see fit.<BREAK> And Black bodies are not the only ones.<BREAK> Imagine if textbook writers such as Macrina more often took the time to discuss and contextualize events like how the government and medical providers tricked Black people in Mississippi into receiving vaccinations, or the forced sterilization of Black women, or how the intersection of mental health and institutionalization of women in general led to them being experimented on and sterilized at higher rates, or the long-term ethical and social implications of classifying certain people as "morons."<BREAK> More and more, the effects of these kinds of historical objectification are understood as linked to lowered health outcomes, higher rates of chronic illness, and greater morbidity for Black people and women in the United States, and a longstanding history of thinking of the neurodivergent and people with mental disabilities as "less than."<BREAK> The omission of these discussions from textbooks and other broad public discourse exemplifies a persistent failure to fully contextualize the history and implications of these events.<BREAK> That this failure presents in so many ethical sub-disciplines might help to explain how people have so often managed to convince themselves that testing on marginalized populations without their informed consent can be said to serve the "greater good."<BREAK> More often than not, "professional ethics training" or any other kind of take on the humanities within business or the so-called hard sciences becomes synonymous with a particular understanding of how not to get sued.<BREAK> The perspectives that get passed along are those of experts in the field in question, be it business, technology, medicine, or what-have-you.<BREAK> Leaving the social science and humanities training of students to people who were only ever trained in this narrow, subdisciplinary fashion is precisely what leads to the continual dismissal of ethical, moral, and sociopolitical considerations, and said dismissal then, in turn, gives rise to Technoableism.<BREAK> If various groups want to change bodily forms and embodiments, or even just change the way that we all interact with the planet on which we currently live so that we might survive the next 30 years, then they will have to radically reconsider how our sociopolitical forces and the elements of our lived experience impact the decisions we make about the science we do and tools we create.<BREAK> The historical positioning of the lived experiences of marginalized people in terms of race, gender, disability, and so on has meant that while we are more than happy to test and degrade certain people for their embodiments, we have been less than willing to allow those same to shape and direct the technoscientific discourse of which they have forcibly been made a part.<BREAK> This distinction, though unarticulated, matters a great deal, and its effects and implications run rampant throughout every facet of our society.<BREAK> If humans do manage a future in which they travel into and live in space, they will need to change the kinds of embodiments and relations they have in order to survive; to do this, they will need to think in vastly different ways about the nature of technological and scientific projects they undertake.<BREAK> Our societal future imaginings are rife with assumptions about what kind of people are best suited to exist and these have been shaped by the historical positioning and treatment of many marginalized groups.<BREAK> Left unexamined, these assumptions and precedents will likely mutate and iterate into each new environment into which humans spread, and affect every engagement of human and nonhuman relationships.<BREAK> But, if we bring a careful, thorough, and intentional consideration to bear on the project of weaving together biomedical, interpersonal, sociopolitical, and technomoral concerns, then we might be better suited to both do right by those we've previously oppressed and agilely adapt to the kinds of concerns that will face us, in the future.<BREAK> As Haraway discusses in her (flawed but possibly still salvageable) "Cyborg Manifesto," the language of the cybernetic feedback loop does not belong only to humanity as a way to describe its own processes‚Äîcybernetic theory and the myth of the cyborg are also frameworks which can be used to describe the cycles and processes of nature, as a whole.<BREAK> Through this understanding, Haraway and others have argued that all of nature is involved in an integrated process of adaptation, augmentation, and implementation which, far from being a simple division between the biological and technological is, instead, a reflexive, co-productive process.<BREAK> Using the theorists and examples above, I've argued for an understanding of biotechnological intervention and integration as the truth of our existence with and within technology.<BREAK> Our bodies and minds are shaped by each other and exist as bodyminds, and those bodyminds dictate and are shaped by the technologies with which they interact.<BREAK> In order to carefully construct and live within vastly complex systems, it will be crucial to understanding the lived experiences of those whose embodiments and bodyminds have placed them at a higher likelihood of being marginalized by those who demand a "right kind" of lived experience.<BREAK> Only by allowing them to create a world out of the lessons of their lived experience will we be better able to intentionally craft what this system and its components will learn and how they will develop.<BREAK> What should characterize our understanding of the cyborg, then, is the reflexive, adaptive relationship between the sociotechnical, sociopolitical, ethical, individual, symbolic, and philosophical valences of our various lived experiences.<BREAK> The point in saying that "Cyborgs Have Always Been About Disability, Mental Health, and Marginalization" is not to say that the category of the cyborg should be Disclosed to cyborg anthropologists and philosophers who say "we have always been cyborgs."<BREAK> Rather, it's about highlighting the fact that a category which was invented specifically to address the lived experiences of marginalized and oppressed people has been co-opted and transformed into a tool by which to erase the experiences of those very same people.<BREAK> We can, and indeed should, still make use of the Harawayan cyborg, the metaphor for entanglement and enmeshment, both as individuals and communities, but we must do so in a way that honours both the original meaning and the evolution of the concept.<BREAK> We must recognize that disabled people, the neurodivergent, trans folx, Black lives, women, queer individuals, and those who sit at the intersection of any number of those components comprise individual lives and communities of experience which are already attuned to changing and adapting to suddenly hostile environments, and it is these kinds of lives which should stand at the vanguard of how we understand what it means to be a cyborg, moving forward.<BREAK> Because the concept of the cyborg was never about a perfectible ideal, it was always about survivability, about coming into a new relational mode with ourselves, our society, and our world.<BREAK>
